text: ' LOS ANGELES: Meryl Streep and Judi Dench   two of Hollywood s most respected
  actresses   lashed out at movie producer Harvey Weinstein on Monday but said they
  were unaware of his decades of alleged sexual harassment of women. As Hollywood
  moved to distance itself from Weinstein, Streep said she had been appalled by the
  claims made against the film studio executive she once likened to  God  in a 2012
  awards speech. His  behaviour is inexcusable, but the abuse of power familiar,  Streep
  said a statement. Britain s Dench   who won a supporting actress Oscar in 1999 for
  the Weinstein-produced film Shakespeare in Love  said in a statement she was  completely
  unaware of these offences, which are of course horrifying . Stars like Streep and
  Dench, whose movies had been championed by Weinstein, have been under pressure to
  speak out after a New York Times investigation last week detailed claims by multiple
  women of unwanted physical contact by Weinstein over three decades. Weinstein, 65,
  initially apologized but later threatened to sue over the allegations uncovered
  by the newspaper. He has not been charged with any crimes but was fired on Sunday
  as co-chairman of the Weinstein amid fallout from the Times story. In a statement
  to the Huffington Post, Streep said she had been unaware of claims that Weinstein
  undressed in front of actresses and assistants and asked young women to give him
  massages.   The disgraceful news about Harvey Weinstein has appalled those of us
  whose work he championed,  Streep said. Producer and director Kevin Smith said on
  Monday he regretted taking money from Weinstein s production company. He financed
  the first 14 years of my career   and now I know while I was profiting, others were
  in terrible pain. It makes me feel ashamed. https://t.co/T0hInW7EqJ   KevinSmith

  ashamed,  Smith   who s known for the comedies Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back and
  Clerks,   wrote on Twitter. Actresses Ashley Judd and Rose McGowan have said Weinstein
  sexually harassed them and movie director Judd Apatow and producer Megan Ellison
  are among those have spoken out in support of them. Weinstein is the latest US media
  or entertainment industry titan to face sexual harassment accusations. At Fox News,
  late Chief Executive Officer Roger Ailes was forced out in 2016 and anchor Bill
  O Reilly resigned in April after similar claims. More than 50 women have accused
  comedian Bill Cosby of sexual assault. Cosby faces a retrial in April on the one

text: 'The dawn of  Naya Pakistan  has set in, but some things in this country remain
  unchanged. Censorship on media and crushing of dissent is in full swing and there
  does not seem to be an end to it (not anytime soon at least) because the new government
  appears to be close to the usual suspects i.e. the establishment. Last week, three
  family members of Sindhi human rights activist Sanaullah Aman were abducted from
  their house by  unidentified  men. Aman is a leading voice against enforced disappearances
  in Sindh and has been campaigning for the release of Sindh s  missing persons. In
  June this year, I interviewed him about the state of human rights in Sindh particularly
  the issue of enforced disappearances. It was shocking to learn that police officials
  refuse to file FIRs in cases involving enforced disappearances saying that the abductors
  are  more powerful  than them. When activists raise their voices against an abduction,
  the abductee is immediately declared criminal or  fugitive  by local police, allegedly
  on orders of agencies. In instances where the missing persons have returned home,
  they discontinued their activism out of fear (and understandably so). After a missing
  person is recovered there is no accountability for those who picked them up in the
  first place, and the vicious cycle continues. While we celebrate the democratic
  transition of power, it is important to be reminded that freedom of speech is one
  of the cornerstones of democracy   without which   the democratic system is in jeopardy
  Mysterious abductions are currently taking place across the country and a significant
  number of the recent victims of enforced disappearances were progressive activists.
  In a report issued in May, the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances
  claimed to have received 5,177 cases of alleged enforced disappearances since its
  inception in 2011. Enforced disappearances were previously limited to conflict-ridden
  areas such as Balochistan and the erstwhile Federally Administered Tribal Areas
  (FATA), but the practice has recently expanded to target dissenting voices across
  the country. The purpose of enforced disappearances is clear: silencing of dissent.
  With such hostility and intolerance for criticism being the norm, the space for
  alternative views has considerably shrunk over the past few years. Therefore, it
  is tough being an activist in Pakistan, especially if you are critical of the military
  s policies. Because thanks to the propaganda fed to the nation, an average Pakistani
  thinks those questioning the army s handling of affairs are enemy agents or  anti-state
  , ignoring the fact that there is nothing wrong   legally or constitutionally   with
  criticism of the armed forces. Moreover, there is little understanding among the  patriot  types
  about what the criticism of military entails because instead of understanding the
  argument put forth by the critics, the hyper-patriots are quick to doll out certificates
  of treason. For starters, when progressive activists (who are on the receiving end
  of abuse as well as violence these days) criticise the military, soldiers of Pakistan
  army who risk their lives for the country are not to whom they are referring. Flawed
  policies of generals who consider themselves above the law are the focal point of
  the aforementioned criticism directed at the military. If it weren t for these wrong
  choices, our soldiers wouldn t have needed to sacrifice their lives while fighting
  a home-grown enemy in their own country. Therefore, it is important to keep reminding
  the deep state to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past. Furthermore, institutional
  overreaches and infringement of public liberties including freedom of speech are
  among the reasons why the deep state is criticised by democrats. Pakistan recently
  saw second successful transition of power from one democratically-elected government
  to another. While we celebrate this progress, it is important to be reminded that
  freedom of speech is one of the cornerstones of democracy, without which, the democratic
  system is in jeopardy. As things stand, civilians who dare to disagree with the
  military are being sidelined or silenced. What is worse is that there is little
  to no defiance in the face of the aforementioned attempts to clampdown on free speech.
  In the months leading up to the general elections, electronic and print media was
  under pressure from the powers-that-be to give limited coverage to political parties
  that are on the wrong side of the establishment. Former prime minister Nawaz Sharif
  s media talks prior to his arrest in July, for instance, were heavily censored on
  electronic media. This censorship on media continues till date. News of a protest
  sit-in against security forces in Miranshah, Waziristan was blacked out by mainstream
  media. The new Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry has lifted  political censorship  from
  state-owned media and vowed to give editorial independence to Pakistan Television
  (PTV) and Radio Pakistan, which is a step in the right direction. But it is about
  time something is done to bring an end to censorship on private media as well. All
  democratic forces including senior journalists should raise their voice against
  the ongoing attacks on free speech, because a fully-controlled system is anything
  but democracy.  The writer is Assistant Editor, Daily Times. She Tweets @AiliaZehra

  saying the Punjab Overseas Pakistanis Commission (POPC) office has been closed for
  some days. The POPC turned out to be very helpful to me, slightly over a year ago.
  I had left Lahore to live in the UK, and had rented my old home to a family. Just
  a few weeks after I had settled in the UK, I found out that the people renting my
  house were refusing to pay their dues. When I called them, they spoke to me in a
  threatening tone, and rather than agreeing to move out or pay what they owed, they
  attempted to extort money from me. Upon the recommendation of a friend, I contacted
  the POPC. Not only did they take note of my problem, they successfully removed the
  family from my home and obtained the money that was owed to me. The Overseas Pakistanis
  Commission (OPC) have proven to be a blessing for Pakistanis living abroad. Sadly,
  our country has a land-grabbing and land-mafia problem, and thus the services provided
  by the OPC are very important. It should be noted that the POPC was a pet-project
  of the senior leadership of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) for the past
  five years. Therefore, considering the political rivalry between the PML-N and Pakistan
  Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), it is possible that the closure of the POPC office is politically
  motivated. I sincerely hope that the new government will not indulge in such unproductive
  actions and that the POPC office will re-open immediately. SHAHID AFZAL Bradford,

text: '  How the Hermit Kingdom Can Be Changed  President Donald Trump has ordered
  the US army to  stand ready  for the fight against North Korea. Harsh words were
  exchanged between Trump and Kim Jong Un during the UN General Assembly session and
  later Trump promised to  totally destroy  North Korea by taking military action.
  Kim Jong Un found Trump a  gangster playing with fire . Trump also criticised China
  that if China is not going to solve the North Korean issue, the United States will
  solve it. Back channels and negotiations were held between Washington and Pyongyang,
  but there was no outcome and the United States suspended secret negations with North
  Korea, calling it a  waste of time . At this stage, China was not taken as an interlocutor
  to negotiate between them. The China-North Korea tale is not as simple as it is
  frequently mentioned by leaders and analysts these days. All the tables in many
  capitals wrongly turned on China to use its leverage in resolving the North Korean
  stalemate. Beijing tries but there are certain constraints and limits and China
  understands its limits. The shadow of the Sino-Vietnamese war of 1979 also lingers
  on China s role in North Korea. Washington often undermines these Chinese limits
  on North Korea and insists on  doing more . China intervened in the Korean War in
  1950 and saved North Korea and signed the treaty of mutual friendship and aid in
  1961. Today there are discussions in Beijing to revoke this treaty. China did not
  side with the north in the Korean War because of the Communist love affair. Chairman
  Mao Zedong considered mountainous Korea as useful ground to fight back the American
  troops and the United Nations  forces on the land than Taiwan divided by sea ruled
  by hostile General Chiang Kai-shek. The end of the Mao era, also ended China-North
  Korea Communist affair. Together, China and Japan can reform North Korea. The United
  States should stay at bay and just watch how things progress on that front China
  s adaptation to economic reforms and opening up of its free-market base economy
  in 1978, was viewed unenthusiastically by North Korea as somewhat harmful and marked
  an end to Socialism.  There was another  Cold War  between Peking and Moscow in
  the 1950s and continued during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s.
  North Korea was more aligned with the Soviet Union than with China. At one time,
  Kim Il Sung also doubted his trust on China in unifying the Korean Peninsula. North
  Korea is isolated diplomatically but it was China that accorded it a place. There
  have been frequent high level diplomatic exchanges when Premier Kim Il Sung visited
  China in 1953. Kim Jong Ill visited China eleven times until 1991. His successor
  Kim Jong Il visited twice in 2000 and 2004 respectively. The last high-level exchange
  was made in May 2011 when Kim Jong Il met with Premier Wen Jiabao in Beijing. He
  also visited China in May and August 2010 and July 2006. In October 2005, 2009 and
  2010, Premier Wen Jiabao visited Pyongyang. Kim Jong Un ordered the execution of
  his uncle Jang Song Thaek, the country s chief interlocutor with China and a relatively
  reform-minded official. The relations are never smooth between the two countries
  since then. China adopts a harder stance and raises its voice with other major powers
  and at the United Nations condemning North Korean provocations. Pyongyang does not
  receive much needed diplomatic and economic support from Beijing any longer. Avoiding
  a fall out on China in case of a military eventuality against North Korea, China
  repeatedly calls for calm, restraint, and a negotiated settlement on the Korean
  Peninsula. From Mao to Xi relations with the DPRK have considerably changed. However,
  unlike both of his predecessors, Kim Jong Un never undertook any visit to China
  after becoming the Supreme Leader of the DPRK. Ever since China distanced itself
  with the DPRK to a large extent. This was major shift in DPRK s relations with China.
  He missed out a chance to visit Beijing in 2015. Kim Jong Un was invited by China
  to participate at the 70th anniversary of the end of World War but he refused to
  make his first out-of-country visit as head of state because President Xi Jinping
  regretted to sit next to him on the reviewing stand at the parade. The relationship
  is not as close as lips and teeth any more. Kim Jong Un also disregards meeting
  important Chinese officials who are sent to Pyongyang for mutual consultations.
  A major irritant after the assassination of Jang Song Thaek, was the mysterious
  murder of Kim Jong Un s half-brother, Kim Jon Nam, at the Kuala Lumpur airport in
  February this year. These events changed the complexion of ties between Beijing
  and Pyongyang. What are the possibilities if the traditional relationship changes
  between China and North Korea? China is a free-market economy. It has an emerging
  global role to play in world s politics. The coming Sino-Japanese normalisation
  could also influence North Korea and it may look for help in trade and investment.
  Together, China and Japan could reform North Korea. The United States should stay
  at bay and just watch how things would move around North Korea.   The writer is

  potential encounter with dharna politics. That it does not come from the main opposition
  but, rather, from the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) means that many will see
  this as a case of deserved retribution. For Khadim Rizvi and his cohorts have unveiled
  plans to hold the federal capital hostage once more. And this time around promises
  to be not so different from the last. Back then, of course, when the group effectively
  accused the then PMLN government of blasphemy over a clerical error   Khan, instead
  of calling for calm, chose to insist that the in-house inquiry into the matter be
  made public. And today, he stands on the receiving end. For the TLP has announced
  a long march from Lahore to Islamabad scheduled for this week. Admittedly, the state
  itself is not in the religo-political party s direct line of fire. But, in reality,
  this amounts to little more than mere semantics given that the latter is doing its
  best to push the new set-up into a corner over blasphemy. Indeed, the TLP has said
  that it will stay put unless and until the government cuts all diplomatic ties with
  the Netherlands over a proposed blasphemous cartoon competition organised by leader
  of the opposition, Geert Wilders. To be clear, there is no need for a sit-in at
  this stage. Not when the Senate has adopted a resolution protesting the move and
  has agreed to take the matter to the UNSC. Not when the Foreign Office had already
  registered an official complaint with the Dutch authorities. Not when the controversy
  is all set to be brought up at the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) Council
  of Foreign Ministers powwow next month. All of which begs the question as to what
  the TLP has to gain from the anticipated dharna at this time? The short answer is
  that Rizvi is keen to build on the relative success that this party enjoyed in its
  first-ever general election; which saw it field more candidates than the PPP in
  the Punjab. And while the TLP failed to secure any National Assembly seats it did
  win two in Sindh. Moreover, the party took home more than two million votes in both
  the Lower House and in the provinces. Which of course represents a not unreasonable
  show of strength for a group that came into political being as recently as 2015.
  And as Rizvi has already said: the TLP is in it for the long haul. The litmus test
  for Khan therefore rests in how he handles the situation. Much of which will depend
  on the support he can muster from the joint opposition. It is extremely important
  that the mistakes of last November are not repeated; whereby notions of standing
  with an elected government gave way to opportunism across the board. That vacuum
  was filled by the Army who acted as a broker of peace between the agitators and
  the state. Again, the pressure is on to avoid a similar scenario. It is sincerely
  hoped that vendetta politics does not win so early in the day.  * Published in Daily

text: ' Back in my university life, feminism, as a discourse, used to fascinate me
  a lot as a student of Political Science. The reason for the fascination was twofold:
  One reason was objective in nature and the other was subjective. Knowing the fact
  the way the world had been objectively striving to make the states  economic development
  models gender inclusive in nature through Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with
  respect to which Pakistan had very poor indicators, I wanted to understand what
  were the factors that were impeding Pakistan s progress towards those objectively
  defined goals. On the subjective front, it invoked my interest because its discourse
  was challenging. It challenged my overall way of looking at the world, keeping in
  view I belonged to one of the religiously conservative districts in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
  Studying its discourse was nothing less than learning, unlearning and relearning
  my approach to understand social dynamics of the society I was part of; that is
  why I even pursued my final thesis about women empowerment in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
  After having studied theoretical discourses related to feminism, having discussed
  its various nuances with a diverse spectrum of students from different backgrounds
  in Pakistan and having observed Pakistan s slow pace to catch up with feminist ideals
  being followed at large across the world, I have come to the conclusion that though
  the government has been taking steps to meet the criteria defined for women empowerment
  through comparisons with SDGs by taking steps in legal, economic and political spheres,
  yet it has hardly been making any substantial efforts in making its discourse heard
  among masses; as a result, every time the government tries to portray an outlook
  of pluralist Pakistan to the world, through laws aimed at women empowerment in any
  sphere of life, it has to face a formidable backlash from the masses. This is what
  happened recently with many legislations passed at Punjab Assembly for women empowerment.
  Almost everyone in the academia promotes the idea of women empowerment, but I have
  rarely come across someone who seems seriously concerned about the issue and wants
  to debate its nuances in a critical manner Although a plethora of human rights organisations
  are working for women empowerment in Pakistan- through following the mantra of personal-is-political
  and highlighting case stories of women  woes in order to not only subjectively aware
  the masses so that they understand the severity of the issue but also to push the
  government to take steps for women empowerment through pressure of the global media
  s attention   are working hard to make the discourse related to women empowerment
  perceptible among masses yet it is the sheer responsibility of the government to
  make sure it utilises every platform, especially academia, to educate masses about
  various nuances of women empowerment in which the government seems to have utterly
  failed. The best platform the government can optimise to spread its message of women
  empowerment to wider masses is academia. In academia, the government can sponsor
  research projects related to gender-related issues in the society and can arrange
  conferences over its various facets.  This will help students engage in meaningful
  ways and will help mold their minds about the issue in general. Students equipped
  with nuanced gender discourses will be messengers in their own society. However,
  honestly speaking, as per my observation, making government a punching bag for not
  customising academia for the promotion of pluralist society with reference to gender
  in Pakistan will be a sheer injustice to academia itself. Almost everyone in academia
  promotes the idea of women empowerment, but I have rarely come across someone, very
  few I would say, who are seriously concerned about this issue and want to have debates
  over its nuances in a critical manner. Deep below their superficial disposition
  towards women empowerment is embedded pervasive conservatism that has enveloped
  the society. Pakistan s pursuit of pluralist society through women empowerment in
  actual terms is not possible by taking objective measures in the likes of laws in
  order to meet the criteria of SDGs. Instead, it needs to engage its citizens subjectively
  on this issue. And the only way to do so is to educate the masses about the significance
  of the issue through critical discussions. Incredible things can happen if we start
  talking about this issue to one another. Since my graduation s thesis, I have come
  across students from a vast spectrum. Majority of them were from very conservative
  backgrounds like me. I was amazed to hear in conversations with them that they also
  found discourses related to women empowerment thought-provoking. The point in sharing
  my conversations with students from far-flung areas is that there is curiosity among
  students for counter-narratives. If they are provided with a counter-narrative apart
  from popular social narrative which society feeds them about role of women day,
  they can turn popular paradigms upside down through power of their imagination and
  can turn out to be harbingers for a gender inclusive society in Pakistan in the
  near future. Otherwise, their imaginative power will be used by the society for
  reinforcing its own conservative paradigms. There is a dire need that an inclusive
  effort is made to bring gender-related issues into public sphere so that its discussion
  is not perceived as a taboo anymore. Its discussion is made as normal and as significant
  as any political issue by masses which it does with a lot of interest. Exposing
  its masses to critical debates about women empowerment can help Pakistan achieve
  a pluralist society instead of chasing solely objective measures defined by the
  world which are out of touch with the challenges in Pakistan for gender mainstreaming.   The

  in two years, which left two people dead and 11 wounded in Jacksonville, before
  the gunman killed himself at a video game tournament. Witnesses told local media
  that the gunman, identified by police as David Katz, 24, of Baltimore, was a disgruntled
  gamer, angry because he lost Sunday s tournament. It was not clear if he knew his
  victims. While police have not identified the victims, family members told Jacksonville

  11 other people were wounded by gunfire and at least two others were injured while

  according to the venue s website. The winners of the contest go forward to the video
  game finals in Las Vegas and compete for $165,000. The latest rampage occurred amid
  a debate over US gun laws that was given fresh impetus by the massacre in February
  of 17 people at a high school in Parkland, Florida. Two years ago a gunman killed
  49 people at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando. President Donald Trump has been briefed
  and is monitoring the situation in Jacksonville, the White House said. Game livestreamed
  The bar was livestreaming a football video game competition when the gunfire started,
  according to video shared on social media. In the video, players can be seen reacting
  to the shots and cries can be heard before the footage cuts off. Taylor Poindexter
  and her boyfriend, Marquis Williams, had traveled from Chicago to attend the tournament,
  and they fled when the gunfire erupted. She said she saw Katz take aim at his victims.  We
  did see him, two hands on the gun, walking back, just popping rounds,  Poindexter
  told reporters.  I was scared for my life and my boyfriend s.  Another gamer, Chris  Dubby  McFarland,
  was hospitalized after a bullet grazed his head.  I feel fine, just a scratch on
  my head. Traumatized and devastated,  he wrote on Twitter. The sheriff s office
  said many people were transported to hospital, and its deputies found many others
  hiding in locked areas at The Landing. A spokesman for Jacksonville s Memorial Hospital
  said it was treating three victims, all of whom were in stable condition. The conditions
  of other patients was not available early Monday. Reacting to news of the shooting
  during the tournament involving its game, Madden 19 maker Electronic Arts Inc said
  it was working with authorities to gather facts.  The tragic situation that occurred
  Sunday in Jacksonville was a senseless act of violence that we strongly condemn,  a
  company spokesperson said to Reuters late on Sunday.  Our most heartfelt sympathies
  go out to the families of the victims whose lives were taken today and those who
  were injured.  Published in Daily Times, August 28th 2018.        '

text: 'It has been one year. Since the Myanmar military launched a brutal crackdown
  on the Rohingya. The ensuing brutality in Rakhine State prompted an exodus of some
  700,00 of this mostly Muslim minority group into neighbouring Bangladesh. Shockingly,
  children account for 55 percent of the total refugee population. Fast-forward to
  the present and the UN has completed a one-and-a-half year-long fact-finding mission
  into the violence. It is one that paints a damning picture of the ruling regime.
  All the more so give that Naypyidaw denied the mission direct access to the country
  while also refusing any cooperation at all levels. Meaning that the latter was forced
  to rely on extensive interviews (875) and documents compiled in numerous field missions
  to Bangladesh as well as other neighbouring countries. Be that as it may, in its
  18-page report, released this week, the world body has recommended that the top
  military leadership be tried for genocide in Rakhine State and crimes against humanity
  in other areas. Either at the International Criminal Court (ICC) or at an ad-hoc
  criminal tribunal; similar to those established in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda.
  It also holds Aung Sang Suu Kyi and her civilian government responsible for not
  stemming the violence. So, what comes next? Hauling Myanmar to the ICC, however,
  will be problematic. The country is not a signatory to the Rome Statute that established
  the Court. This would pass the burden of responsibility to the UNSC to ensure that
  justice is done. But even here, this path will likely not be a smooth one. For bluntly
  put, the major players   those with the power of veto   too, have their vested interests.
  Myanmar is crucial to Beijing s One Road, One Belt (OROB) initiative; promising
  as it does to  link  the Maritime Silk Road (MSR) to the Silk Road Economic Belt.
  There have been Chinese promises to exploit the natural resources of the Buddhist
  majority state. In addition, the near-end of the West s love affair with Suu Kyi,
  just three years after it supported her sweep to power in general elections, serves
  a resurgent Moscow. Both China and Russia have been engaged in training the Myanmar
  military. With the latter also playing the role of arms supplier. That being said,
  the West cannot claim moral authority when it comes to the bigger picture. After
  all, the Rohingya have endured state-sponsored persecution for decades. Such as
  the right to citizenship, which has been withheld since as far back as 1982. Yet
  the West s support for human rights over the years has focused almost exclusively
  on Suu Kyi and her years of house arrest that spanned a total of a decade and a
  half; with scant regard for systematic abuses of the most vulnerable. Thus if countries
  like the US and UK force a showdown over the prosecution question   they will invite
  calls of politically motivated manoeuvring and selective justice. Particularly at
  a time when the West has still to be held to account for military adventurism in
  the Muslim world. It is therefore hoped that the permanent five put aside self-serving
  regional interests before the UN mission presents its full report to the Human Rights
  Council next month. For time is running out.  *  Published in Daily Times, August

text: ' Forget about Ides of March, month of October too has been ominously significant
  for Pakistan. On October 16, 1951 a hired assassin s bullet to subvert democracy
  was fatally pierced into the heart of Pakistan s first Prime Minister Liaquat Ali
  Khan   most trusted lieutenant of the founder Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah.
  Earlier, he had survived an abortive quasi-military coup led by an army general.
  Ever since then democracy has never had a smooth ride. As per the historic data
  plus circumstantial evidence available, Liaquat was the first victim of cold war
  politics. It was either organized or carried out at the behest of a super power
  since he was adamant not to be part of its sinister scheme of things. He had refused
  to help Americans with Pakistani troops in the Korean War and declined to be part
  of Anglo-American conspiracy to oust popular Iranian Prime Minister Dr Mossadegh
  when he nationalised Anglo-Iranian Oil Company fleecing Iran of its oil wealth.
  Significantly, this year marks the 200th anniversary of the birth (October 17, 1817)
  of the greatest Indian Muslim reformer of the 19th Century   Sir Syed Ahmad Khan.
  Rightly called father of Muslim Renaissance in post 1857 India, only a man of his
  stature, vision, perseverance and determination could pull the Muslims out from
  the mire of decadence and re-launch them as a nation of substance. He picked them
  from the status of  hewers of wood and drawers of water  and ignited in them the
  spirit to seek education, respect, equitable opportunity and fight for their rights.
  He was the first to differentiate between Muslims and Hindus as two separate nations   two
  beautiful eyes of one body. Days of political importance and of seminal consequences
  are quite a few. Pakistan s first martial law was imposed on October 7, 1958 by
  President General Iskander Mirza. He abrogated the 1956 Constitution, dismissed
  Prime Minister Feroze Khan Noon just a few months before he was to announce first
  ever general elections. This illicit sharing of power arrangement could not last
  long and General Ayub showed his true colours by packing up Mirza on October 27,
  1958. So did we see the birth of Doctrine of Necessity for justifying subversion
  of democracy, constitution and rule of law   courtesy Chief Justice of Pakistan,
  Mr Justice Muhammad Munir   to sanctify might of the generals to play roughshod
  with the country s future. Mian Sahib has drawn battle lines. He considers himself
  a master in the art of confrontation. His daughter, too, is following in his footsteps.
  And unlike Punjab s political tradition, his party has stuck together and is rallying
  behind him  It also saw the emergence of a power troika comprising of generals,
  civil bureaucrats and superior judges   that, backed by Punjab s feudal elite created
  by the Raj and theocratic warlords who had opposed Pakistan   got into recognizable
  shape to replace MAJ s idea of a secular social welfare state with that of a garrison
  state. Presidential form of government was introduced and seeds of Pakistan s break
  up sowed, Gen Zia s coup and judicial murder by him of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Pakistan
  s first populist Prime Minister   were all sounds of death knell. One cannot encapsulate
  here all that happened in 70 years, one gets over to yet another coup on October
  12, 1999. An overly ambitious Prime Minister seeking to be Ameerul Momineen on the
  footsteps of Mulla Omar of Afghanistan, decided to get rid of his Army chief General
  Pervez Musharraf and then got knocked down by GPM s boomerang. Had his foreign mentors
  namely Saudis and American President Clinton   not intervened to save his neck,
  he would been a foot note in history.  Mian Sahib has drawn battle lines. He considers
  himself past master in the art of confrontation. His daughter too is following his
  footsteps. And surprisingly   unlike Punjab s political traditions   his party is
  still sticking together. Even people like Ch Nisar who pose as the most holy among
  the holiest, do whimper quite often and host an attitude of hostility but refuse
  to bite. Obviously MNS  message of defiance are rightly being considered as offensive
  and due attention is being given by the Establishment. Clash of institutions continues
  to threaten the federation. While the First institution is being obliquely challenged,
  highest judiciary seems to be a clear target as the villain of the piece for unseating
  for him the pleasure of powers that be. MNS and his family members disqualified
  by the Supreme Court, initially seemed reluctant to appear before the Accountability
  Court- is it change of heart, saner advice or adoption of new strategy? One would
  tend to see more of strategy in it in keeping with his overall policy of defiance.
  First hearing of Mian Sahib s appearance in the Accountability Court seemed to be
  a piece of rewind of 1997 when PLM-N goons thoroughly desecrated the Supreme Court
  and forced its Chief Justice to resign. Mian Sahib is both born again democrat and
  an ideologue as he calls himself. His stand is also sound that how long would the
  nation be helpless witness to see elected prime ministers sent home by the establishment.
  However, his claim that he has been disqualified for his revolutionary development
  programme to usher in over all good for the people and that there has been no corruption
  in his government   can only make one laugh at this psycho pathetic state of mind.
  His first dismissal was on charges of corruption, second for more corruption, over
  ambitious aggrandizement of power and attempt to completely obliterate opposition
  and voice of dissent. His overwhelming majority in National Assembly almost got
  him to be Ameerul Momineen but for the PPP dominated Senate that did not let it
  happen. It was his excessive abuse of power, vendetta against opposition leaders
  and illegal massive accumulation of wealth through mega corruption coupled with
  his own Bonapartist ambitions made General Pervez Musharraf take over. Popularly
  it was considered a blessing in disguise   welcomed by people who had been fed up
  by his style of governance. While people distributed sweets, his party beneficiaries
  found safety in their holes. Situation at that, one apprehends that the policy of
  confrontation   though politically romantic it sounds   may not end in repeating
  history.   The writer is former High Commissioner of Pakistan to UK and a veteran
  journalist     Published in Daily Times, October 11th 2017.       12Shares '

text: ' In response to article, Fudging & fraudulence published in Daily Times on
  October 1, 2017], a clarification, issued by Ministry of Finance, which was published
  on October 8, 2017. In the article historical data with evidence was presented to
  show how Shaukat Aziz and Daniyal Aziz accused the sitting Finance Minister of figure
  fudging. He till today has not filed any case of defamation against them. Daniyal
  Aziz is now part of Cabinet of which Dar is also a member! In the article alleged
  fudging of figures and fiscal data during the era of Musharraf-Shaukat and Pakistan
  People Party (2008-2013) was also highlighted. It was not Ishaq Dar specific or
  targeted article. It was to show how our successive governments were manipulating
  data to show rosy picture at fiscal front. The spokesperson of Ministry of Finance
  even did not bother to look at the references and links of stories quoted in the
  article that alleged withholding of refunds personally at the orders of Finance
  Minister and how he twisted the arm of Federal Tax Ombudsman and Chairman Federal
  Board of Revenue (FBR) to disown the report posted on website. In the article, Muhammad
  Zubair, Governor of Sindh was quoted allegedly accusing Ishaq Dar of cheating ousted
  Prime Minister-the clarification is totally silent about it. Governor specifically
  said that  businessmen are facing hardships due to long pending tax refunds . If
  there is no issue of refunds as portrayed in the clarification, Governor Zubair
  should be asked to withdraw or clarify his statement. Spokesperson should ask the
  Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) to issue a Press
  note that businessmen have no issue of pending refunds with FBR. In the clarification,
  the spokesperson took much pain to prove that FBR has issued more refunds than earlier
  years. This is not the issue. The issue is why all the outstanding refunds are not
  paid. Law does not allow withholding of refunds. Refunds should be issued as per
  time limit provided in statutes and not according to schedule of payment decided
  by Finance Minister of anybody else. He is not above law of the land. Who has given
  authority to Finance Minister or Chairman FBR to announce the schedule of payment
  of refunds, mentioned in the clarification as under?  It was announced that refund
  payment orders issued up to April 30, 2017, shall be paid in two stages, i.e. by
  July15, 2017 and August14, 2017, in respect of RPOs up to Rs. 1 million and above
  Rs 1 million, respectively. Total refund amounting to Rs 26,338 million on account
  of sales tax has been paid in the current financial year against 10,579 cases of
  exporters as well as non-exporters. Overall in the CFY 2017-18, a refund of Rs 41
  billion has been paid against Rs 18 billion in PFY 2016-17 recording a substantial
  growth of around 120 percent . The reality is that Ishaq Dar admitted before National
  Assembly s Standing Committee on Finance, Revenue, Economic Affairs, Statistics
  and Privatisation on November 26, 2015 that quantum of refunds payable was over
  Rs. 200 billion. Spokesperson before issuance of clarification should have seen
  the record of Parliament. It was own confession of Ishaq Dar and this time not under
  duress!! In the past, the Finance Minister Ishaq Dar and Chairmen FBR have been
  lying before the Standing Committees of Senate and National Assembly about quantum
  of refunds due. On May 13, 2014, the then chairman FBR claimed that  only Rs97 billion
  were payable as refunds . On November 26, 2015, Ishaq Dar and new chairman admitted
  that the actual figure was Rs. 200 billion. The last claim in the clarification

  and reported in the budget documents  is contrary to the facts as per following
  story [ Government shows Rs.212b statistical error to cut budget deficit , The Express
  Tribune, September 8, 2016]:  In an apparent attempt to conceal the worsening fiscal
  position, the government has declared a spending of Rs212 billion as a statistical
  discrepancy aimed at nullifying the impact of lower-than-targeted revenue collection
  and excessive current expenditures. According to a summary of fiscal operations
  for financial year 2015-16 that the Ministry of Finance released on Wednesday, there
  was a statistical discrepancy of Rs212.1 billion in budgetary books. Statistical
  discrepancy means revenues and expenditures whose source and purposes are not known
  for the time being. Receipts from the United States and the State Bank of Pakistan
  (SBP) fell short of targets whereas the government cut its development budget by
  Rs107 billion to make up for the revenue shortfall. There is a clear indication
  that the government has deliberately declared the statistical discrepancy. In table
  one of fiscal operations, total expenditures of federal and provincial governments
  were Rs5.8 trillion. But in table three, the expenses were above Rs6 trillion in
  2015-16 that ended on June 30. It is for the second time that the discrepancy has
  swelled to that extent. Earlier, in 2013-14, it stood at Rs215 billion after $1.5
  billion, declared as a gift from Saudi Arabia, was placed under this head. During
  its first three years in power, the PML-N government has booked Rs605 billion as
  statistical discrepancy, five times more than the statistical errors of Rs117 billion
  shown in last three years of the PPP government. Can spokesperson of Ministry of
  Finance tell the nation about above facts and figures? If the report was false what
  action did the Ministry took against it? The article, fudging & fraudulence, was
  based on published reports and documents. In the clarification, no rebuttal is made
  in respect of these reports and documents. The spokesperson may better take up the
  matter with Governor Muhammad Zubair who openly accused Ishaq Dar of not only keeping
  Nawaz Sharif in dark about refunds but also painting before him wrong picture of
  economy. The issue of non-payment of refunds and taking advances for showing higher
  revenue collection should be probed by Public Accounts Committee with the help of
  an audit firm of international repute. It is high time that this process should
  start immediately. The spokespersons of Ministry of Finance and FBR should come
  forward and offer their accounts for audit. It will be in their own interest to
  prove what they have claimed in clarification issued to this newspaper.   The writer,

text: 'An asylum-seeker boat has reached Australia for the first time in almost four
  years, the government said Monday, with many of those on board the Vietnamese vessel
  fleeing into mangrove rainforest after it ran aground in crocodile-infested waters.
  Locals said passengers from the rickety vessel disappeared into the dense forest
  near the Daintree River, north of popular tourist city Cairns, in the tropical far
  north of Queensland state on Sunday. They will have to avoid crocodiles, venomous
  snakes and giant cassowaries   one of the world s deadliest and aggressive birds   that
  all call the ancient Daintree rainforest home. Queensland Police Minister Mark Ryan
  told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation 15 passengers had been found so far.
  The ABC added that two others, including the boat s captain, were still missing.
  The Brisbane Courier Mail reported that up to 20 were unaccounted for. It said those
  detained were well dressed and in good health. State Emergency Service area controller
  Peter Rinaudo said earlier his crews were searching through the mangroves and near
  the mouth of the river, reportedly with dogs.  It ll be a hard slog, it s still
  quite warm in there and it ll be tough conditions for the guys,  he told the ABC.  I
  hope the people, however many there are, get located   it s not a nice area for
  them to be in.   Home affairs minister Peter Dutton said the partially sunk vessel
  had come from Vietnam and was the first boat of asylum-seekers to reach the country
  since 2014.  Australia, we believe, has received the first  people-smuggling venture
  in over 1,400 days,  he told reporters.  We will work with the agencies to make
  sure we can repatriate these people back to their country of origin, once we understand
  the facts of the matter.  Dutton did not confirm how many passengers were on board
  or their nationalities. Illegal fishing Under Canberra s tough immigration policy,
  asylum-seekers who try to reach Australia by boat are either turned back or sent
  to remote Pacific camps where conditions have been widely criticised. They are blocked
  from resettling in Australia. The United Nations and human rights advocates say
  the policy violates the 1951 Refugee Convention of which Australia is a signatory.
  Dutton reaffirmed the government s stance on Monday, saying the boat s arrival was  a
  reminder that people-smugglers have not gone out of business .  We ve had a very
  proud record, over the course of the last few years, and we aren t going to take
  a backward step. The people-smugglers  will not succeed in putting people on to
  boats to get to Australia.  Most asylum-seeker boats that have arrived in Australia
  in recent years embarked from Indonesia, though some originated in Sri Lanka. Former
  Border Force chief Roman Quaedvlieg tweeted Monday that Vietnamese fishing boats  have
  been illegally fishing in fleets  off the far north Queensland coast in the past
  two years due to their own depleted fishing stocks.  Possible the Daintree vessel
  & crew have used this activity as a staging point to make Oz landfall & avoid returning
  to VN (Vietnam),  he added. Published in Daily Times, August 28th 2018.        '

text: ' According to research, man-made political and economic institutions determine
  economic success (or the lack of it). It is important to forge a society that creates
  incentives, rewards innovation, and allows everyone to participate in economic opportunities.
  The economic success thus made possible is sustained because the government becomes
  accountable and responsive to the citizens it governs. What makes a difference is
  the politics that create completely different interrelated sets of norms as well
  as institutions that help make the society dynamic and effective in terms of inputs
  and desired outputs. Historical evidence and case studies give ideas of positive
  and negative factors of growth and development. To address current questions relating
  to poverty, disease, illiteracy, and standard of living of the people as well as
  internal and external threats to the state, we need to build a new theory of political
  economy. Interplay between political and economic institutions is important to understand
  for a way forward. Of utmost importance is the need for maintaining harmony and
  balance within and among the institutions. Specifically checks and balances in the
  triangular relationship between the legislature, the executive and the judiciary.
  An effective system of authority, responsibility and accountability is essential
  for good governance and fair play. It is vital for the government to ensure that
  the writ of the state is firmly established and that all three wings of the government
  function in an environment of understanding, cooperation, and uniform national outlook.
  Jihadis were initially created and nourished by the US for its own goals and objectives.
  There is    no justification for them to use blame games after the tremendous sacrifices
  of men and material offered by Pakistan Unnecessary tensions damage the image of
  institutions which reduce their efficacy at achieving their required and desired
  goals and objectives. Politicians should refrain from making unnecessary statements
  and comments that become road-blocks to progress. Statements which negatively impact
  the process of innovation and support required for facilitating the socio-economic
  development. Reflection is necessary for everyone to correct themselves and help
  in nation building efforts. There is no room for  blame games  and uncalled for
  comments which express little but negativity. To put it straight there is a need
  for cordial Civil-Military relations at a stage where the state is facing existential
  threats, both internal and external.  The situation in Afghanistan has not improved
  after 16 years of the War on Terror for which the Bush administration had often
  utilised coercive tactics and threats to make Pakistan part of the coalition force
  under the leadership of the United States and NATO. Despite of the fact which is
  known to all, that peace in Pakistan depends on peace in Afghanistan, the Trump
  administration seems to be employing the same game the Bush administration used
  to pressurise Pakistan. Arm-twisting will not help. It is time for the United States
  (US) to do more. US Defence Secretary Mattis  stance on Xi Jinping s One Belt, One
  Road initiative has many contradictions. The US had supported the project at a forum
  in Beijing earlier this year Jihadis were initially created and nourished by the
  US for its own goals and objectives. There is no justification for them to use blame
  games after the tremendous sacrifices of men and material offered by Pakistan to
  root out terrorism and terrorists of any specification. Pakistan is always open
  to talks and to reason but will not accept any undue strategy and action, especially,
  when Pakistan s arch-rival is a friend of the United States. When business-as-usual
  starts to threaten the state and it s legitimacy, out of box solutions are required.
  We need visionaries who can come up with long term solutions. Inspirational and
  motivational statements are necessary. But the reality of internal and external
  threats cannot be denied. We simply cannot afford to live with the sources of these
  threats. We need to keep our eyes open. Analyse facts, separate them from fiction.
  Politics is an instrument to be used with care.  There are indications which can
  help understand current situations to better predict tomorrow. According to the
  Pakistani Foreign Office, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) will benefit
  the Af-Pak region and beyond. The US has been asked to focus on human rights violations
  in Kashmir. US Defence Secretary Mattis  stance on Xi Jinping s One Belt One Road
  (OBOR) initiative has many contradictions. The US itself had supported the project
  at a forum in Beijing this year. Moreover, the Trump administration is enhancing
  trade ties with China. The question is how could the United States ignore Indian
  efforts to create instability in Pakistan? Apparently the current policy employed
  by the US is directly or indirectly supporting the Indian agenda. As a country often
  referred to as  the leader of the free world  the United States has the responsibility
  to stand upright and speak the truth. Peace is possible through joint efforts. It
  takes two to tango. I request President Trump to reintroduce passion into fashion;
  to bring back humanity and positive human values into action. It will be a great
  contribution if Trump delivers on his promise to help reduce tensions between India
  and Pakistan. That is the only road to peace in this region.   The writer is a former

text: ' Is Trump going to survive the media and judicial assault regarding the Travel
  Ban and the US-Mexico Border Wall? Will Modi succeed in transforming secular India
  into an India overshadowed by Hindutva? And how will Brexit will affect European
  politics and the fate of the European Union? Although, these questions sound a bit
  far-fetched, their relevance cannot be denied. The history of the world is witness
  that almost every century contains certain elements of society in a nation rising
  against the prevailing status quo. In the US, Trump s  Make America Great Again  and
  subsequent rise to power was a result of his rightist-nationalistic thoughts and
  fervour. His promises to build the wall, ban on certain Muslim countries and to
  bring jobs and industry back to the American people paved the public opinion in
  his favour. Again, Modi s consolidation of power in India though perceived as a
  surprise by many was the right-wing extremist Hindutva ideology of the Rashtriya
  Swayamsavek Sangh (RSS) and the Sangh Parivar with almost 90 years of conspiracies
  and mischievous plans, which finally paid off. The roughly 53 affiliated organisations
  of RSS have virtually taken over all of India. The book Bharatiya Janata Party and
  the Indian Muslims (2014) by Dr Muhammad Mujeeb Afzal describes that BJP as the
  political wing of the RSS. In Angela Merkel s Germany, the historical injustices
  done to the German nation whether it was the Treaty of Versailles, Lend-Lease Agreement,
  or the occupation and subsequent division of Germany into East and West Germany;
  have cast an indelible mark on the strategic thinking of the German nation. The
  policies of Angela Merkel are not only centred on Germany but the role played by
  German Foreign Minister Frank Walter Steinmeier (now German President) in the Iranian
  Nuclear Deal (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action-2015); where the P5+1 was in fact
  dominated by him. To assume that Germany after the fall of the Berlin Wall and its
  re-unification in 1991 again rose to the status of a great power in just 20 years  time
  is not entirely incorrect. Seemingly, Brexit happened due to the domination of EU
  by Germany that was unacceptable for US and UK. It is a fact that world politics
  is taking a turn in favour of the right-wing and conservative political parties
  and leaders. Is it due to the inherited anarchic international structure or a backlash
  of politicising liberal values around the globe? The recent statement by Trump that
  Germany owes money to NATO and US is a clear sign that the great powers are again
  terrified by the tremendous progress made by the German nation in almost every walk
  of life. With Francois Fillon or Marine Le Pen or Benoit Hamon as President in Paris,
  it is certain that France will also leave the EU just like Britain. Marine and Hamon
  are more inclined towards the right in comparison with Fillon. France is in a constant
  state of security dilemma due to the growing power and influence of Germany, not
  only in the EU but also internationally. Whoever comes to power in France, it would
  lead the Fifth Republic to the path dominated by conservatism and protectionism.
  Similarly, the Fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 was translated by many as the emergence
  of a unipolar world. But with President Putin, Russia has gained the international
  attention and is determined to preserve the Assad Regime in Syria. This has led
  many to believe that the international system is increasingly becoming multi-polar.
  His concrete determination made Forbes magazine declare him as the most powerful
  man in the world. With Shinzo Abe as the Prime Minster of Japan, the tensions in
  the Pacific are high. His conservative ambitions are further fuelled by his repeated
  visits to Trump. The historic Sino-Japan rivalry is bringing Tokyo and Washington
  much closer and with the blessings of Trump, Abe is increasing its presence in the
  South China Sea. Trump s proposal during his election campaign to arm Japan with
  nuclear arsenal; if materialised would be the beginning of an ugly conflict in the
  Asia-Pacific.   Interestingly in Austria, right-wing Norbert Hofer was defeated
  by Alexander Van der Bellen in the 2016 Elections, but it is fascinating that he
  had 46 percent of the popular vote in his favour. In Turkey with Tayyip Erdogan
  s rightist policies, Ankara has regained its regional and international importance.
  His growing relations with Putin with solid criticism on the West and Israel have
  made him a perfect rightist-conservative. Likewise, Philippines remained a colony
  of democratic America for many decades but with Rodrigo Duterte as President, the
  people of Philippines have given their verdict while breaking the status-quo. It
  is a fact that world politics is taking a turn in favour of the right-wing and conservative
  political parties and leaders. Is it due to the inherited anarchic international
  structure or a backlash of politicising liberal values around the globe? Many analysts
  and political minds contemplate and perhaps are sceptical of the  Rise of the Right  on
  the international level. But provided the changing geopolitical and geostrategic
  environment, it would not be incorrect to conclude that the phenomenon is not only
  real but is rising at a remarkable speed. A dimension can be drawn from the above
  discussion and facts that the  New Cold War  might turn  Red Hot  real soon.   The

text: 'Translating his words to action on conserving public funds, Prime Minister
  (PM) Imran Khan s adoption of a temperate lifestyle with only two supporting staff
  is a clear signal for the political elite around him, as well as the civil bureaucracy.
  Hopefully, this move will bring about some positive change. Though it is clear that
  more than anything else, this is a symbolic gesture. Some meaningful decisions also
  emerged from the new government s first Cabinet meeting. PM Imran Khan and his team
  have shown vigour to take up austerity measures that they expect will save billions
  over the years if implemented in letter and spirit. Abolishing of the discretionary
  funds and taking up the projects to the parliament for their formal approval would
  certainly lead to constitutional supremacy over the whims and wishes of the individuals
  sitting in Parliament and the Cabinet. However, eliminating corruption will be the
  Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government s top priority. The decision to take up
  the forensic audit of the mass-transport projects in Multan, Islamabad, Peshawar
  and Lahore   including the Orange Line Metro Train Project   is highly appreciable
  for the sake of transparency and accountability. When similar projects in Khyber
  Pakhtunkhwa (KP) are omitted from the list, the whole endeavour becomes an exercise
  in political victimisation. Why is auditing mass transport projects more important
  than auditing all civil and military development projects initiated over the past
  ten years? Regardless, the new government s reassurances that it will retrieve money
  stolen from the country has given the nation hope yet again. However, economists
  believe that the expert selected by the new government   who has experience working
  with NAB   has no idea how these funds are to be retrieved under the bilateral or
  multilateral tax treaties signed by Pakistan. This is an observation the government
  should cross-check for the sake of its own credibility. The federal government could
  ask that the Rangers be deployed in the country s northern areas to combat indiscriminate
  deforestation. Illegal timbre must be confiscated. The toothless forest departments
  and district governments simply aren t up to this task The decision to ban the use
  of special aircrafts for foreign tours of top government and state dignitaries could
  save a significant amount for Pakistani taxpayers. Restricting everyone to the club-class
  for their international travel could prove instrumental in changing the social climate.
  The drive will become unbelievably significant and meaningful if the PM, his cabinet
  and parliamentarians travel in the economy-class. The Cabinet has also decided to
  make our cities clean and green through a country-wide urban tree plantation drive
  and new sanitation projects. Malik Amin Aslam, an Advisor on climate change and
  the environment, has yet to come up with details about the tree plantation initiative,
  but we know the government intends to plant 10 billion saplings over the next five
  years. Malik Amin Aslam is perhaps our only politician who is a well-respected environmentalist
  in Pakistan and abroad. He holds the position of global vice president with the
  International Union of Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN). As such,
  expectations are very high. However, his critics have pointed out many flaws and
  lacunas in his  Billion Tree Green Tsunami , campaign which was said to be marred
  by corruption as well.  Strangely, every government, from the federal to district
  level, is interested in planting millions of saplings twice a year. Still, none
  of them have been able to offer a solution to the indiscriminate deforestation plaguing
  our country. Saving four million trees a year from the timber-mafia will be much
  more effective at combatting climate change than planting billions of new saplings.
  Furthermore, the timber-mafia could not function if it was not supported by the
  political elite and bureaucracy. Good initiatives cannot bring change until criminal
  practices are allowed to continue. The present federal government has been labelled
  the  establishment s baby . This could be an opportunity for the federal government
  to ask that rangers  be deployed in the country s northern areas to combat indiscriminate
  deforestation. Illegal timbre must be confiscated by the government. The toothless
  forest departments and district governments simply aren t up to this task. Only
  the rangers could help in recovering the hundreds of thousands of logs waiting to
  be transported downstream. Immediate action can stop the money from going into the
  pockets of the mafia. Additionally, selling the timber on higher bids in the open
  market could bring good money to the national exchequer. Regarding the sanitation
  projects, the Cabinet decided to form a taskforce to prepare plans for a countrywide
  cleanliness drive. Another taskforce is to review the issue of urban housing, with
  particular attention to matters related to slum settlements across the country.
  These are pertinent decisions indeed. The Cabinet has also vowed to complete all
  projects started under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). This must have
  brought a sigh of relief to the Chinese government and Chinese companies. Regardless,
  the Pakistani government needs to safeguard commitments made with China and other
  countries while negotiating with the US delegation due to visit on September 5.
  Pakistan s interests must be given priority over demands from Washington. The writer

text: ' Smear campaign against Saleem Safi is unjustified Saleem Safi reported that
  Mian Nawaz Sharif had paid over Rs 6 million to the state exchequer for his personal
  expenses. This infuriated the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf s (PTI) supporters. They
  initiated a vicious campaign against him, calling him all kinds of names. He was
  described as a stooge of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), who has been
  receiving money from the Sharif family. However, Haroonur Rasheed defended him,
  though he didn t name him. He deplored that the PTI supporters had subjected the
  journalist to a campaign of vituperation. Those who know him will testify to the
  fact that he has never been anyone s stooge. He has never sang the praises of any
  ruler or leader. He has been a critic of Nawaz Sharif for the last four years, and
  earns enough money to not have to depend on PML-N handouts. In fact, he makes more
  money than the Army Chief and the Prime Minister (PM). However, he lives frugally.
  Regardless, those making these allegations did not hesitate for a second. It seems
  this society is going from bad to worse, but nobody is concerned. How the PTI chief
  got rid of Awn Chaudhry Saleem Safi wrote in an Urdu newspaper that Awn Chaudhry
  has been Imran Ahmad Khan Niazi s right-hand man and special confidant for many
  years. He used to be seen everywhere with Imran. I saw many PTI bigwigs kowtow to
  him. However, for some time we had been getting the impression that Imran wanted
  to get rid of him, but he was waiting for the appointment of his ADC. Awn was tasked
  with the drawing up of the guest list for the oath taking ceremony. Many PTI leaders
  were begging Awn to invitation cards until 2 AM. Surprisingly, at the ceremony he
  was conspicuous by his absence. Unexpectedly, instead of Awn Chaudhry, Zulfi Bukhari
  was seen with the First Lady. Upon meeting his military secretary, the new PM issued
  his first order:  Awn Chaudhry should not be seen anywhere near the Aiwan-i-Sadar
  or the PM s House.  Imran is the first person to become PM with people s power On
  August 18 a prominent TV news channel quoted PML-Q leader and former PM, as saying
  that Imran Khan is the first person who became PM with the people s power. He stated
  21 earlier PMs, including himself, were made by other powers. He went on to say
  that he himself  made  two PMs with his own hands. Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry
  said that the recent clash with members of the Ahmedi community started over a cockfight
  and that it had no religious dimension Imran Khan worked hard for 22 years to achieve
  his mission. No earlier PM achieved this office through practical struggle. All
  of us should cooperate with him, so that he accomplishes his 22-year-old goal. It
  must be added that in 2002, Imran Khan had complained to the State Bank that Chaudhry
  Shujaat Hussain and Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi had gotten a loan of Rs 240 million written-off.  Ahmadi
  place of worship torched According to a report published in a prominent English
  newspaper on August 24, 31 people were injured and an Ahmadi place of worship was
  set on fire following a verbal spat between two groups of youngsters in Ghaseet
  Pura RB-69, a village near Faisalabad, on August 23. A youngster riding a motorcycle
  ran over a chicken belonging to an Ahmadi family, starting the conflict. Slogans
  were shouted, shots were fired, stones were pelted, and a nearby Ahmadi place of
  worship was damaged and set on fire   all in the presence of police officials. Jasarat,
  Jamaat-i-Islami s mouthpiece, reported on August 25 that as a result of an attack
  perpetrated by Ahmadis , one Muslim had been killed and 22 injured. Khalid Lateef
  Cheema, secretary general, Majlas-i-Ahrar, was quoted as saying that this incident
  was the result of promoting Qadianiyyat. While addressing a press conference, Information
  Minister Fawad Chaudhry said that the conflict started over a cockfight and that
  it had no religious dimension. Fazlur Rahman for breaking-off diplomatic relations
  with the Netherlands Maulana Fazlur Rahman, the chief of the JUI-F and the MMA,
  has said that by announcing the publication of blasphemous cartoons, the rulers
  of the Netherlands are playing with the sentiments of Muslim Ummah. This was published
  in a report in a notable Urdu newspaper. Fazlur Rehman called the competition  open
  terrorism  and demanded that Islamabad break-off diplomatic relations with the Netherlands.
  He went on to say the Islamic world should urge the UN to make laws to ensure that
  sacred personalities and religions are respected. Blasphemy against every prophet
  should be declared a crime and it should be punishable by death. He termed those
  organising this contest the biggest enemies of the Islamic world. Islamic countries
  should break their silence and take a brave stand in this regard. Islamabad, get
  ready for another Tehreek-i-Labbaik sit-in Khadim Hussain Rizvi, the Tehreek-i-Labbaik
  Pakistan (TLP) Chief, has announced that his party will hold a long march from Lahore
  to Islamabad over the exhibition of blasphemous cartoons in the Netherlands. This
  was in a report published on August 27. The march will start on August 29 and will
  become a sit-in upon reaching Islamabad. The sit-in will continue until Pakistan
  does not break off all kinds of diplomatic relations with the Netherlands. Rizvi
  has demanded the expulsion of the Netherlands  ambassador and has urged the UN and
  other global institutions to give up their old traditions and play their role in
  get the publication of cartoons stopped. The writer has studied international relations
  in Islamabad and media in London. He has worked for several English-language newspapers.
  He has written a book, Handbook of Functional English, for the benefit of those
  who wish to improve their English skills. He can be reached at shakil.chaudhry@gmail.com

text: ' The National Defence University, where I also go occasionally to waste the
  time of the good folks there, holds an annual National Security Workshop (NSW),
  essentially for parliamentarians. I think this event numbers is close to topping
  my  most useful  list of things to do. This year s NSW is drawing to a close and,
  as part of the grand finale, participants are expected to share their views on some
  aspect of governance. This year it is the turn of the National Action Plan. I have
  the honour of mentoring one or two of the groups this time round. And they have
  chosen as their subject, Military Courts. Attending their discussions, I found myself
  constrained to offer advice. Thus I am writing this piece to share those views here,
  on this forum. To begin with, Military Courts are an anachronism and an aberration
  to the modern concept of justice. Having said that, with some reluctance, I must
  also admit that circumstances sometimes render even aberrations a necessity. Our
  current state, in which injustice rules, judges, investigators, prosecutors, and
  witnesses are all under threat, is perhaps one in which the aberration is a necessity.
  The groups under my mentorship agreed. Nevertheless, they did have some apprehensions.
  Foremost was whether capital punishment falls within the  doctrine of necessity
  ? If it does, how, then, are we to justify this to the international community?
  How can we avoid being ostracised as well as having our Generalised Scheme of Preferences
  (GSP plus) status revoked? The latter point is pertinent given that such a move
  would exacerbate our already precarious economic situation. Since I have no intention
  of debating the ethics or efficacy of capital punishments here, I move beyond. In
  legal parlance there is a term Amicus Curiae, which is Latin for  friend of the
  court . Usually a well reputed judge or lawyer sits not as a member of the court
  but in an advisory capacity, whereby his opining represents a matter of record.
  This could be the way forward for our military courts That we are at war is more
  or less an established fact. This is a war. The enemy is the most insidious one
  there can be,  The Enemy Within . Relentless and cruel to the extreme; we are at
  war. However, in wars, soldiers fight each other on the battlefield. And, those
  operating behind enemy lines are required to declare themselves. Only then do the
  Geneva Conventions apply. Pointing out current American practices as well as the
  socio-legal safeguards the US has emplaced by executing blatant injustice by way
  of military courts, but far from US soil, is a very poor example to quote. Moreover,
  Washington enjoys a unique status, even at the UN; which we don t. However, before
  the world body overtly began to do the US bidding, we have the example of UN-approved
  Military Trials after WW II, notably at Nuremberg.  While the precedent for  War
  Crimes  trials was set at Leipzig after WW I   it was at Nuremberg where concepts
  of War Crimes, Crimes against Humanity, and War of Aggression crystallised into
  international jurisprudence. Consequently, the first step to justify recourse to
  Military Courts and Capital Punishment is to establish that these courts are set
  up to deal with War Crimes. Definitions of War Crimes as set out in UN manuals are:  intentionally
  killing civilians or prisoners, torture, destroying civilian property, taking hostages,
  perfidy, rape, using child soldiers, pillaging, declaring that no quarter will be
  given, and serious violations of the principles of distinction and proportionality
  . Is there anything in this list that our terrorists have overlooked? I see nothing
  missing. They are committing all of the above and then some. Our defensive argument
  has to hinge on proving that:  a) we are at war; and b) that those engaging us in
  this war are guilty of War Crimes. If we can establish these two facts   we need
  not worry about the international community or, indeed, our GSP plus status. However,
  at Nuremberg, the four states which contributed to the trials all provided a judge
  to preside over each hearing. The Russians were the only ones who produced soldiers
  as judges; which posed some difficulties, even at Nuremberg. The film, Judgment
  at Nuremberg deals with precisely this subject. Most non-military personnel hold
  the view that no judicial representation exists within our military court system.
  Actually, this is not strictly true. It is mandatory for every military court to
  grant procedural access to a member of the military judiciary, the Judge Advocate
  General, JAG Branch, where all members must have a law degree. Yet this is not without
  problems. For while these learned folk may know the law   they may not be jurists
  and, consequently, may not comprehend  beyond reasonable doubt    a concept to which,
  I am not sure, should be strictly adhered. As at Nuremberg, one solution might be
  to have a high court judge as a member of each military court bench. Here again
  we are likely to face our psycho-social complexities pertaining to our old friend,
  the ego. In other words, a high court judge may find it below  His Lordship-ly  honour
  to sit on a military court. But, where there is a will, there is a way. In legal
  parlance there is a term Amicus Curiae, which is Latin for  friend of the court
  . Usually a well reputed judge or lawyer who sits not as a member of the court but
  in an advisory capacity, whereby his opining represents a matter of record. Our
  military courts could, while retaining the compulsory member of the court from the
  JAG Branch, have a reputable lawyer as per Amicus Curiae. Any Pakistani advocate
  willing to take on this  challenge  will only have his reputation enhanced. While
  our military courts will enjoy genuine civilian judicial presence and, one hopes,
  also a jurist present.   The writer is a retired brigadier. He is also former vice

text: 'Pope Francis has declined to comment on a claim he personally ignored sexual
  abuse allegations against a senior clergyman, after a visit to Ireland dominated
  by Church scandals. Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano, a former Vatican envoy to the
  United States, said he had told Francis of the allegations against prominent US
  cardinal Theodore McCarrick in 2013. But rather than punish McCarrick, who was forced
  to resign last month, Vigano said Francis had lifted sanctions imposed on him by
  his predecessor Pope Benedict XVI. Vigano called on Francis to resign in a letter
  published Saturday in the National Catholic Register. He said the pope  knew from
  at least June 23, 2013, that McCarrick was a serial predator,  adding that  he knew
  that he was a corrupt man, he covered for him to the bitter end . But the pope refused
  to address the brewing scandal on Sunday.  I will not say a word about that. I think
  that the communique speaks for itself,  Francis said on his plane as he flew back
  from Dublin to Rome. He had  begged for God s forgiveness  for past clerical abuse
  scandals during his landmark trip to Ireland, where they have badly damaged the
  image of the Catholic Church.  He said he was demanding  firm and decisive  measures
  to find  truth and justice . Nope to the pope Before 45,000 supporters at the rain-soaked
  Knock shrine in the west of Ireland on Sunday, the pope spoke of the  open wound  of
  the scandals. He later said mass to tens of thousands of flag-waving worshippers
  before heading back to Rome after his two-day visit. He also acknowledged other
  abuses by the Irish church, including at its so-called  mother and baby  homes for
  unwed mothers. In the Irish capital, about 5,000 abuse victims and supporters braved
  the weather to attend a  Stand for Truth  rally. A woman dressed as a nun, with
  fake blood on her hands, and a man handing out homemade placards reading  The church
  protects pederasts  were among those protesting. It was the first papal trip to
  Ireland since John Paul II spoke in front of 1.5 million people during a visit in
  1979.  I think it s obviously causing quite a lot of distress,  abuse victim and
  campaigner William Gorry said of the visit.  Healing is something that s going to
  take a long, long time if it s going to happen at all,  he told AFP. At another  Nope
  to the Pope  demonstration, protesters called for gay and transgender recognition,
  a clearer separation of religion and state in Ireland and the acceptance of contraception
  by the Vatican   as well as action on abuse. The pope went to Ireland to close the
  2018 World Meeting of Families   a global Catholic gathering that addressed issues
  including the treatment of gay people in the Church. On the plane back to Rome,
  the pope recommended parents seek psychiatric help for children who show homosexual
  tendencies.  When it shows itself from childhood, there is a lot that can be done
  through psychiatry, to see how things are. It is something else if it shows itself
  after 20 years,  he said.  Stain  on the Church Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar
  on Saturday urged the pope to take action against abuses and ensure justice for
  abuse victims worldwide.  Holy Father, I ask that you use your office and influence
  to ensure that this is done here in Ireland and across the world,  he said, calling
  the scandals a  stain  on the Church and state. The pope met eight abuse victims
  on Saturday, including a woman assaulted by a priest when she was in hospital aged
  13. On the plane to Rome, Francis said he  suffered a lot  at the meeting. He also
  said he was particularly moved by the plight of unmarried girls forced to give up
  their children for adoption.  I had never heard of it,  he said.  It was painful
  for me, but accompanied by the consolation of being able to help clarify these things.  The
  Church s standing has been badly dented by the abuse scandals and the Irish have
  shed traditional Catholic mores, voting earlier this year to legalise abortion after
  approving same-sex marriage in 2015. Multiple probes in Ireland have found Church
  leaders protected hundreds of predatory priests and former Irish president Mary
  McAleese revealed this month that the Vatican had sought to keep Church documents
  inaccessible to government investigators. The abuse scandals in Ireland are part
  of a worldwide crisis for the Vatican. A devastating report earlier this month accused
  more than 300 priests in the US state of Pennsylvania of abusing more than 1,000
  children since the 1950s. Published in Daily Times, August 28th 2018.        '

text: ' I am a Pakistani-American, one who straddles two distinct cultures. Living
  in both Pakistan and America, my take home lesson about politics in both countries
  is this; the power systems on both sides have the ultimate power over all that matters.
  In July, there was an opinion piece published in the New York Times, which alleges
  that the powerful establishment led by the Army in Pakistan has always created a
  king s party to further their agenda and smash the party the establishment didn
  t like. The author goes on to suggest based on-for lack of a better word-whim, that
  PTI is the King s party today. Most of the noise on social media is made by the
  PTI stalwarts   who obviously deny being the King s party   and those journalists,
  anchors, and book authors who regard the Times article as a Godsend for their ritualistic
  Imran Khan bashing. On social media, they are usually referred to as lifafa journalists.
  The Times article is interesting not for what it says, but for what it doesn t say.
  Conspicuous by its absence from the Times article is the issue of campaign finance
  in American elections. All cultures and races have different versions of the same
  thing. Some are visible to the naked eye, others can only be seen with eyes closed.
  In America, the caucasians smoke Marlboro lights while African-Americans smoke menthol
  cigarettes. Pakistani doctors drive BMWs or Mercedes and so do the Arabs, who smoke
  shisha with their food, while Pakistanis drink black tea with theirs. The point
  is that everyone has a unique manner of doing things. In America, I have worked
  at gas stations and have taught at colleges. I have dealt with people stealing soda
  cans and I have also sat down one on one with Noam Chomsky. Having seen many layers
  of American society, I know that America too has King s parties. The Republican
  and the Democratic parties are King s parties. Their Kings are the rich corporations.
  Having seen many layers of American society, I know that America too has king s
  parties. In fact, both Republican and the Democratic parties are kings  parties.
  Their kings are the rich corporations The role of money is not new in American politics.
  However, in the wake of the US supreme Court decision in the Citizens United v FEC
  case in 2010, it has become legal for unlimited cash to manipulate American elections.
  In the 5-4 court decision, the majority opinion argues that corporations have the
  same First Amendment rights as individuals. Political Action Committees (PACs) existed
  before with some limitations on their donations. But Citizens United case paved
  the way for Super PACs with virtually no limitations on the size of donation to
  a candidate during an election campaign. The new normal is for corporations to drench
  the election campaign with massive amounts of cash using Super PACs to influence
  elections. Positive campaign ads for the blue eyed candidate are aired, while at
  the same time malicious ads are aired targeting the opponent. The candidate with
  more money at his disposal usually wins. The winner then has to put his weight behind
  the kind of legislation that will help the  sugar daddy  corporation. The vicious
  cycle goes on. In the meantime, the biggest losers are the American public and the
  American democracy. The only winner is the King. The people s speech is just words
  while the corporations  speech is cash. Guess who is going to win, cash or words?
  Many Super PACs make hefty donations to election campaigns of the Republicans, the
  party that worships the Second Amendment right: the right to bear arms. The National
  Rifle Association (NRA) spends a stupendous amount of money in creating  awareness  about
  the importance of self-defense and the Second Amendment. The irony is that gun violence
  claims more American lives than terrorism, yet the Super PACs supporting gun rights
  are not deemed dangerous.  The National Rifle Association spends a stupendous amount
  of money in creating  awareness  about the importance of self-defence and the Second
  Amendment. The irony is that gun violence claims more American lives than terrorism
  According to a 2016 study by Alex Nowrasteh at the Cato Institute, about 3,024 Americans
  have died from 1975 through 2015 due to foreign born terrorists. This number includes
  the 2,983 deaths from 9/11. In the same period, guns claimed 1.34 million American
  lives. That s about as many Americans as died in all the wars in American history
  since the American Revolution. Notwithstanding, the mindset is: foreign terrorists
  are more dangerous than the domestic shooter. Similarly, domestic buying of the
  White House, which I will discuss shortly, isn t considered detrimental to American
  democracy. However, foreign (Russian) meddling to influence the election outcome
  is deemed a more sinister plot to harm America and its democracy. Strange logic!
  In 2008, Obama raised roughly $750 million. In 2012, Obama raised $1.123 billion,
  while Romney raised $ 1.019 billion. Every subsequent election is costlier than
  the previous one. The 2008 election spending was $5.3 billion, $6 billion in 2012,
  and $6.6 billion in 2016. American Kings have their free speech and their favorite
  party. The interesting part is that they don t even hide in plain sight. It is deeply
  internalised that money is needed for campaigns and corporations  free speech ought
  to be respected. I would like to point out that Pakistani Kings try their best to
  hide, knowing full well that Pakistanis know what the truth is. American Kings don
  t have to hide because they have blunted the free speech of the American people
  by controlling their minds. That is a more sinister plot than the one that encourages
  a party   called the King s party.   The writer is currently a PhD candidate at

text: 'Human Rights Watch (HRW) has drawn the attention of the newly-elected Prime
  Minister to a wide-ranging agenda that deserves the immediate and full consideration
  of his cabinet. Not least because the global watchdog has outlined a preliminary
  roadmap to redress the historic rights deficit here in Pakistan, covering: freedom
  of expression; freedom of religious belief; violence against women and girls; access
  to education; outlawing the death penalty; and counter-terrorism. Indeed, we would
  like to remind Mr Khan that the country is a signatory to the Universal Declaration
  of Human Rights (UDHR). And that the Pakistan Constitution guarantees a number of
  fundamental citizenry safeguards. To be sure, Kaptaan and his team have some hard
  work ahead of them if they are to realise the dream of Naya Pakistan for all.  The
  starting point of which must be the protection of rights for everyone. Indeed, the
  benchmark for any state with pretensions of being a liberal and tolerant democracy
  is inherently tied up with the treatment of minorities. In the current global climate
  where all eyes are fixed on the potential execution of a woman human rights defender
  in Saudi Arabia   it becomes an inconvenience to recall that Pakistan s Asia Bibi
  risks being the first woman in this country to face the death penalty for alleged
  blasphemy. Towards this end, HRW has urged the Khan government to amend the relevant
  laws as first step towards ultimate repeal; as well as doing away with the ban on
  the Ahmadi right to religious practice. Sadly, the breathing space has been co-opted
  by the violent religious right to such a dangerous extent that even considering
  such moves is to invite bloody and murderous consequences. Yet to maintain the status
  quo is to sacrifice the most vulnerable. Thus the new set-up has the next five years
  to change the narrative and initiate dialogue on both these fronts. What cannot
  be repeated is a situation whereby a sitting MPA launches uninterrupted an anti-Ahmadi
  tirade on the floor of the National Assembly. Linked to this is violence against
  women and girls. Given that those belonging to minority backgrounds are doubly prone
  to abuse; including forced conversion. Yet even when discounting this double burden
  of oppression, it becomes clear that Pakistan is not a safe country for women.  Child
  marriage is a concern. As is domestic abuse and so-called honour killings. What
  is therefore needed is for the entire political leadership to lead by example. This
  must begin with ending unwholesome tendencies to police the clothes and behaviour
  of women supporters belonging to rival parties. Similarly, the pitting of notions
  of western feminism against of those of the East does no one any good; least of
  all women themselves. The point is that the new regime, including the opposition,
  must work hard to help women reclaim the public space in terms of not just the physical
  realm but also when it comes to the law and general red tape. It is not sufficient
  for parties to have separate women s wings. All men lawmakers must prove themselves
  to be worthy allies. For the legacy of Naya Pakistan will be found in a gendered
  approach to rights that is equally cognisant of the burden too long borne by minorities.
  We believe the PTI government  Khan  achieve this if it has the will.  * Published

text: 'The first Muslim Prime Minister (PM) of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K)Sheikh Mohammad
  Abdullah viewed the accession of the state to India as a strategic and pragmatic
  necessity, and sought to justify it by deploying the rhetoric of socialism and secularism.
  Regardless, he continued to harbour hopes for the creation of a sovereign Kashmir.
  In October 1949, the Constituent Assembly of India reinforced the stipulation that
  New Delhi s jurisdiction in the state would remain limited to the categories of
  defence, foreign affairs, and communications, as underlined in the Instrument of
  Accession. This stipulation was provisional and its final status would be decided
  upon the resolution of the Kashmir issue. Subsequent to India acquiring the status
  of a Republic in 1950, this constitutional provision enabled the incorporation of
  Article 370 into the Indian Constitution, which ratified the autonomous status of
  J&K within the Indian Union. Article 370 stipulates that New Delhi can legislate
  on the subjects of defence, foreign affairs, and communications only in just and
  equitable consultation with the government of the state of J&K. It can intervene
  on other subjects only with the consent of the J&K Assembly. At this point in time,
  Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah made some controversial observations in an interview with
  the London Observer. He voiced his concern over the increased vulnerability and
  instability of J&K caught between two countries that were hostile towards each other.
  He expressed his solicitude over the political and economic hardships that the location
  of the state would cause its populace. The only viable option, according to him,
  was for J&K to have a neutral status vis- -vis both India and Pakistan. However,
  because of the ruptured politics within the state given its diverse political, religious
  and ethnic affiliations, the sovereign and autonomous status of J&K would need to
  be acknowledged and guaranteed not just by India and Pakistan, but also by the UN
  and other world powers. Abdullah s candid observations created a furore in New Delhi.
  His  politically incorrect  views met with particular objection from India s right-wing
  Deputy Prime Minister, Vallabhbhai Patel. Abdullah withdrew his remarks in an interview
  with The Hindu, a couple of months later (Dasgupta 1968: 194). In 1952, Sheikh Mohammad
  Abdullah voiced his relentless hostility towards Hindutva majoritarianism in the
  stronghold of the right-wing Praja Parishad. He referred to the attempts of the
  Congress Party and the central government to enforce the complete integration of
  J&K into the Indian Union as juvenile, impractical and ludicrous (ibid.: 196). Sheikh
  Mohammad Abdullah came from an unpretentious Muslim background, and was motivated
  to fight the structural inequities and state-sponsored injustices wrought by the
  peripheralisation of Kashmiri Muslims In March 1952, Abdullah stated,  neither the
  Indian Parliament nor any other Parliament outside the state has any jurisdiction
  over our state  No country   neither India nor Pakistan   can put spokes in the
  wheel of our progress  (Delhi Radio, Indian Information Service). He further declared
  that  the existence of Kashmir did not depend on Indian money, trade, or defence
  forces, and he did not expect any strings to be attached to Indian aid. Threats
  and taunts would not intimidate him into servile submission (The Times, 26 April
  1952). Perhaps it was an irony of fate that, soon after Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah
  s talks with Nehru regarding the Kashmir imbroglio, Nehru died on 27 May 1964. Prior
  to the change in Nehru s stance towards Kashmir, the two stalwarts had shared a
  commonality of vision: they were tied by an umbilical cord of anti-despotic, socialist
  political beliefs. Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah came from an unpretentious Muslim background,
  and was motivated to fight the structural inequities and state-sponsored injustices
  wrought by the peripheralisation of Kashmiri Muslims who were quarantined in the
  alleyways of poverty, illiteracy and despondency. Nehru came from an elite background,
  had been groomed in the privileged hallways of Harrow and Cambridge, and was a proud
  personage, often arrogant or condescendingly superior in manner. His intellectual
  grooming exacerbated his patronising tone and manner. Despite the fact that the
  two figures, Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah and Nehru, occupied different rungs of the
  social and economic hierarchy, the rapport between them was of critical importance
  to the installation of a democratic regime in Kashmir in 1947. Subsequent to his
  talks with the Indian premier, Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah travelled to Pakistan with
  Maulana Masoodi and Mirza Afzal Beg, in sanguineness and good cheer, to hold talks
  with the Pakistani President, General Ayub Khan. After a series of hopeful conversations
  with Ayub Khan, Abdullah felt confident that the talks were making headway. He visited
  Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistani-administered Kashmir, and was exuberantly
  welcomed by a sea of people (ibid.: 240). During that period, Abdullah did not once
  waver on his demand for self-rule, but he required the cooperation of Pakistan in
  looking for a viable solution to the conflict. The heart-warming response to Abdullah
  and his stance, particularly in the Kashmir Valley, was not well received either
  by New Delhi or its ward at the time, GM Sadiq.  Subsequent to Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah
  s death, even those who had vehemently condemned the political strategies, assessed
  his politics positively. An old associate of his who had migrated to Pakistan, Shahnawaz
  Khan Niazi, describes what he thought Abdullah symbolised:  Sheikh Abdullah was
  a total idealist and his only interest was the best deal he could get for Kashmir
  and Kashmiris. His often repeated statement to me was that destiny had played an
  important role, that circumstances were such that they did not permit him to come
  to an understanding with Pakistan. Every small opportunity he got to make a point
  or establish the separate identity of Kashmiris he took.  (Quoted in Taseer 1986:
  67) Despite the furious opposition of his detractors and the relentless efforts
  of the governments of India and Pakistan to delimit Abdullah s sphere of influence,
  and to dismantle the paradigmatic political and cultural structures built by him,
  his significance as a symbol of Kashmir s unique cultural identity and its stentorian
  demand for self-determination remains indelible. The writer is the author of Fiction

text: 'In 1994, when the Taliban burst upon the scene in Kandahar there was a reluctant
  recognition in Pakistan, that given their astonishing success they could perhaps
  bring peace to Afghanistan at a time when Pakistan s efforts to mediate peace between
  the Afghan factions had failed. This was when the Americans had walked away from
  the region and when other regional powers appeared intent on supporting the factions
  they favoured, caring little for the overall stability of the country. It was also
  when the Mujahideen were busy wreaking greater destruction on Afghanistan than it
  had suffered during the decade long Soviet occupation. We were not alone in this.
  Similar hopes were entertained by the Americans who also sought advantages from
  Afghanistan s location. Our hopes were belied. The Northern Alliance continued to
  hold territory in the North and this rump regime enjoyed recognition and support
  from India, Iran and Russia. The world worried about the Al-Qaeda presence in Afghanistan.
  This was the situation when New York was attacked and a multi flawed US operation
  began The following mistakes   certainly not a comprehensive list   that the Americans
  made in Afghanistan justifiably aroused suspicions and misgivings about their intentions.
  First, in 1996, when Taliban control over a large part of Afghanistan had been consolidated,
  they allowed Bin Laden to fly to Afghanistan from Sudan. In Sudan he was under the
  careful eye of a Sudanese government anxious to keep on the good side of the Americans.
  In Afghanistan, he was revered as a hero of the Jihad in which the Taliban leaders
  had participated as foot soldiers. Second, in their relentless search for Al-Qaeda,
  the US resurrected the warlords, who had gone under cover during the Taliban rule,
  and handed over generous amounts of dollars. They turned a blind eye to the resumption
  of poppy cultivation that had virtually disappeared in the last year of Taliban
  rule. Moreover, they picked up and took to Guantanamo many innocent Afghans fingered
  by these warlords as part of personal vendettas or as part of the struggle for influence
  in their area of operation. Third, they failed to use their own troops to eliminate
  Bin Laden and his followers when they were trapped in Tora Bora. Instead, they relied
  upon Afghan mercenaries with the predictable consequence that either by bribery
  or by devotion, these Afghans permitted Bin Laden to cross into Pakistan and saddled
  us with the problem. Our role in the GWOT was to cleanse our own territory of terrorist
  groups, a task we would have had to undertake eventually Fourth, they convened a
  Bonn Conference from which the Taliban and most Pashtuns were excluded, making intentionally
  or otherwise, the Taliban the representatives of Pashtun nationalism.  Fifth and
  most importantly, they rejected or forced Karzai to reject the Taliban offer to
  return to Afghanistan and live as ordinary citizens in return for amnesty. Sixth,
  they did this as part of a larger scheme to remake the Middle East. They were planning
  a war on Iraq and diverting resources and political attention from Afghanistan.
  Common sense would have dictated that if resources were no longer available for
  Afghanistan, the Taliban should have been granted the amnesty they sought and reduced
  American involvement in Afghanistan to the rebuilding of a country that had been
  more devastated by internecine warfare than by the years of Soviet occupation. Much
  could have been different if the Americans had behaved differently. The important
  point however is that apart from the assistance we provided to the Americans for
  their plans in Afghanistan   our part in the Global War of Terror was to cleanse
  our own areas   a task we would have had to undertake irrespective of what the Americans
  did or did not do in Afghanistan. This was our war and in many ways independent
  of the war waged in Afghanistan. How did our areas become hotbeds of extremism?
  This was at least partly the direct result of the policy of our rulers of the day.
  We had, along with the Americans and then the Saudis and others supported the Afghan  freedom
  fighters  in their struggle against the Soviet occupation. General Ziaul Haq, our
  ruler at that time was anxious to ensure the consolidation of his version of Islam
  in Pakistan. He wanted to use the Afghan Jihad for this purpose. Therefore, he decided
  that the Jihad was to be waged with the slogan of  Islam in Danger  rather than
  the mildly offered American suggestion supported by some of the Mujahideen that
  the deposed King Zahir Shah be brought back from Rome and under his leadership the
  slogan of  Afghan nationalism  be used. The Americans were in this game only to
  impose on the Russians the same humiliation that the Vietnamese had inflicted on
  the Americans. They were prepared to let us determine how this war was to be waged
  and to help us with such things as bringing extremists, among them Osama Bin Laden,
  from all parts of the Muslim world to Peshawar to wage a Jihad against the infidel
  Soviets alongside their Muslim Afghan brothers. We set up this chain of Madaris
  along our border to train Afghans, and unfortunately Pakistanis for the Jihad; and
  entrusted their running to Maulana Fazlur Rehman of the JUI. The Americans then
  helped us devise curricula for the Madaris and this included gems such as an arithmetic
  book which taught addition by saying  One Kalashnikov plus three Kalashnikovs is
  equal to 4 Kalashnikovs . They were prepared to go along with whatever we proposed
  with regard to the many Afghan Mujahideen groups that existed at that time and to
  let us determine the level of assistance each would receive. In one fell stroke,
  we reduced the 29 Afghan parties that existed to seven and decided that of them
  Gulbuddin Hikmatyar s Hizbe Islami (a largely Pashtun Party) rather than Rabbani
  and Ahmad Shah Masood s Jamiate Islami (a largely Tajik party) would be the principal
  recipient of assistance. We were in this Jihad, as the tail that wagged the dog,
  and when the results of our efforts produced not just the Soviet withdrawal from
  Afghanistan but the disintegration of the Soviet Union, there was this heady feeling
  of invincibility in our policy circles. What did we gain? We could complete the
  work needed to ensure a working nuclear weapon capability while the Americans turned
  a not so blind eye towards this development but for the rest we have only loss to
  show for our efforts. This I will dilate on in my next column. Concluded The writer

  \ here and abroad.Perhaps, this solid NPAG background has permitted Shakir Ali Museum\
  \ Director Amna Pataudi to announce classical and folk dance competitions between\
  \ private performers and those from different educational institutions at the museum\
  \ from next month. \u201CThe doors of Shakir Ali Museum are open for the promotion\
  \ of classical and folk dances woven deep into the dance traditions of this region.\
  \ That is why we will like to invite private dance performers and students from\
  \ different institutions to be the part of our competitions to be held after every\
  \ three months gap.\u201D The jury to judge these competitions will be based on\
  \ eminent choreographers, including Zarin Pana from NPAG. Ms Pataudi said the need\
  \ for holding such competitions was felt because there were no first-rate classical\
  \ dancers in line after prominent names such as Naheed Siddiqui, Nighat Chuadhry,\
  \ Beena Jawad and Dr Saga. The director told Dawn on Wednesday NPAG would hold frequent\

  \ in and organising such events abroad. \u201CThe group will perform at the Shakir\
  \ Ali Museum after every two months freshly learnt dances in near future,\u201D\
  \ she said. NPAG, the high-scale dance wing of PNCA established in 2006, has hired\
  \ dancers for training newcomers. The group has inspired choreographers such as\
  \ Roshan Ara Bokhari and Zarin Pana to share their expertise with it. Currently,\
  \ Ms Pana is heading the group as choreographer. Zafar Dilawar who is teacher with\
  \ the group said the performers were being taught six to seven dances every year.\
  \ By now, they have learnt over 100 dances, including Peacock Dance, Candle Dance,\
  \ Cotton Picker\u2019s Dance, Basant Bhar Dance, Jhoomar, Harvest Dance, Dhamal,\
  \ Luddi, and Bhangra, besides Katthak and other forms of classical dance. Though\
  \ the dancers at NPAG were confident that they would change the dance scene in the\
  \ country given the kind of training they had been given all these years, they deplored\
  \ the lack of opportunities to show their skills."

  \ UN assistant secretary for political affairs, Oscar Fernandez Taranco, who wound\
  \ up a visit to Bangladesh on Wednesday confirmed the phone calls by the world\u2019\

  \ League party and the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) held one-to-one\
  \ talks for the first time in years in a bid to defuse the row.BNP and its smaller\

  \ clashes since late October when the BNP-led 18-party opposition movement launched\
  \ the protests calling on Hasina to resign and make way for the polls under a neutral\
  \ caretaker government.The opposition, led by Hasina\u2019s rival Khaleda Zia, has\
  \ said it fears the premier will try to rig the vote in a country plagued by coups\
  \ and political upheaval for decades.Hasina has rejected the demands for her resignation\
  \ and is determined to hold the polls as scheduled, insisting it is a constitutional\
  \ requirement.Observers said although the two parties have held two rounds of talks,\
  \ decades of distrust mean it is unlikely a deal is immediately in the cards.UN\
  \ envoy Fernandez-Taranco said a third meeting between the parties has been agreed\
  \ but more must be done to build confidence.\u201CThere are measures that would\
  \ contribute immensely: a call by all sides to end the violence, release of opposition\

  \ election schedule,\u201D he told a press briefing.\u201CThe leaders have shown\
  \ statesmanship. It remains critical to reduce tension and to continue to engage\

  \ plan to go ahead with the polls without the BNP suffered a major blow last week\
  \ when her key ally \u2014 the Jatiya Party, the third-largest political organisation\
  \ in the country, led by ex-military dictator Hussain Muhammad Ershad \u2014 announced\

  ve snapped a photo of himself at a funeral,\u201D commented the right-wing Fox News.\u201C\
  Mr Mandela was a man who forgave others for some of the cruellest acts against mankind.\

  \ dancing, singing and laughing to honour their departed leader. It was more like\
  \ a carnival atmosphere, not at all morbid. The ceremony had already gone on for\
  \ two hours and would last another two. The atmosphere was totally relaxed \u2014\

  \ their livelihood from the industry.According to PSRMA Chairman Asmat Pervaiz Malik,\

text: "ISLAMABAD, Dec 11: On the last day of his eight-year tenure on Wednesday, Chief\
  \ Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry took up the Balochistan missing persons\u2019\
  \ case and handed down an order. The proceedings of the case saw a verbal clash\
  \ between a counsel and the bench. Heading a three-judge Supreme Court bench which\
  \ had issued a contempt notice to Inspector General of Frontier Corps Balochistan\
  \ Maj Gen Ijaz Shahid, the chief justice ordered that the next-in-command in the\
  \ force be immediately appointed in place of the FC chief who was indisposed and\
  \ admitted to the Armed Forces Institute of Cardiology. When Brigadier Khalid Saleem,\
  \ who is at present heading the force, tried to explain that none of the missing\
  \ persons was in the FC custody, the court said that without a proper notification\
  \ by the interior ministry about his charge he could not be considered to be legally\
  \ holding the command. After the notification, the order said, the acting FC chief\
  \ would ensure that the FC personnel allegedly involved in enforced disappearances\
  \ appeared before DIG of Balochistan Crime Investigation Department Imtiaz Ahmed\
  \ Shah in compliance with the earlier order. It said the new FC chief, along with\
  \ the provincial police and other law-enforcement agencies, would also ensure recovery\
  \ of the missing persons, including Advocate Mir Ahmed Marwani who had been picked\
  \ up from Khuzdar in Balochistan. The new FC chief, the Balochistan chief secretary\
  \ and the inspector general of police are required to appear before the Supreme\
  \ Court on Dec 17 along with reports on progress in recovery of the missing persons.\
  \ The court said that since former FC chief Obaidullah Khattak had earlier given\
  \ an undertaking in the court, all those who had affixed their signatures on the\
  \ commitment to recover the missing persons would also appear before it to explain\
  \ whether they had met the commitment. The court regretted that despite protests\
  \ by relatives of the missing persons, no-one took practical steps to redress their\
  \ grievances. This is evident from the attitude of law-enforcement agencies as well\
  \ as elected representatives who had promised to enforce fundamental rights in their\
  \ election campaigns. \u201CSimilar is the position of the federal government, the\
  \ prime minister and his cabinet as well as the elected representatives, particularly\
  \ from Balochistan, despite the fact that they are aware of the miseries of the\
  \ Baloch people,\u201D the court said. It observed that it was a responsibility\
  \ of the executive authorities discharging functions under the constitution to enforce\
  \ fundamental rights. The court regretted that there had been a hue and cry for\
  \ many years and relatives of the missing persons were continuously holding camps\
  \ in Quetta and even marched to Karachi on foot with their children, women and the\
  \ elderly demanding their recovery. ACRIMONY: At the outset of the proceedings an\
  \ exchange of words took place between the bench and Advocate Irfan Qadir, representing\
  \ FC chief Maj Gen Ijaz Shahid. When Mr Qadir, a former attorney general, insisted\
  \ that he should be heard, the court said that the right of audience could not be\
  \ granted until the FC chief himself appeared to face the contempt charge. He quoted\
  \ a headline in a section of the press that a \u201Cpolitical superstar is born\u201D\
  \ and said that if it was true he would not like to leave his client at the mercy\
  \ of the superstar. And if it was wrong, he said, the court should proceed against\
  \ the media house under Section 8 of the Contempt of the Court Ordinance 2003 so\
  \ that such stories were not published again. The court asked the counsel not to\
  \ force it to take strict action against him. Otherwise, it warned, he could be\
  \ charged for committing contempt at the face of the court under the Supreme Court\
  \ Rules which could entail suspension or permanent cancellation of his licence to\
  \ practice in the Supreme Court. Mr Qadir said he had not committed any contempt\
  \ and all that he wanted was an action against the newspaper. He alleged that the\
  \ bench was sitting with a mindset and getting personal. The court said it was exercising\
  \ restraint and asked the counsel not to be loud in the court. Now it has become\
  \ a question of the dignity of the court. At this Attorney General Muneer A. Malik\
  \ stepped in to request the court to exercise judicial restraint since Mr Qadir\
  \ was his predecessor. The chief justice observed that the power to suspend a licence\
  \ could be exercised by the chief justice straightaway. But the counsel said the\
  \ court could not go ahead or even revoke his licence without hearing him and emphasised\
  \ that the Supreme Court rules were subservient to Article 10-A of the Constitution\
  \ which ensures fair trial. But despite the expectation after intervention by the\
  \ attorney general, Mr Qadir did not offer any remorse or apology, but only demanded\
  \ fair trial from the bench. Detainees\u2019 death: In its Tuesday\u2019s judgment\
  \ in the Adiyala Jail detainees case, the Supreme Court had declared that the death\
  \ of four detainees during custody could not be proved to have been caused by torture,\
  \ thus their death should be considered as natural. The judgment said: \u201CRegarding\
  \ the death of the 4 detainees, the respondents No. 2 to 4 with their reply (CMA\
  \ No. 487 of 2012) have attached their death certificates which show that Syed Abdus\
  \ Saboor expired on 20.01.2011 in LRH due to cardio pulmonary arrest, respiratory\
  \ distress. Tehseenullah expired on 17.12.2011 in LRH due to cardio pulmonary arrest.\
  \ Said Arab expired on 18.12.2011 in LRH due to cardio pulmonary arrest, secondary\
  \ to anaemia and pancyctopaeshia. Muhammad Aamir alias Khalid expired on 13.08.2011\
  \ due to acute renal failure and acute gastroenteritis.\u201D"

  \ nominally in charge of the FSA, and weapons warehouses at the Bab al-Hawa crossing\

  \ US-allied groups. The United States has been concerned the non-lethal aid should\
  \ not reach Islamists.A senior US administration official said that the suspension\
  \ should not be misinterpreted.\u201CThis is absolutely not the beginning of the\

  \ He said the administration was looking for other ways to see how the support can\
  \ be provided to ensure it does not fall into the hands of \u201Cextremists\u201D\

  \ was elected on Wednesday chairman of the Public Accounts Committee of the National\
  \ Assembly.Mr Shah was unanimously chosen as head of the PAC at its meeting held\
  \ at the Parliament House. Bashir Ahmad Virk proposed and Javed Akhlas of the PML-N\
  \ seconded his name.After his election, Mr Shah announced that the committee would\
  \ formally meet on Dec 31.Besides taking up regular audit reports from 1998 onwards,\
  \ the litmus test for Mr Shah-led PAC would be pending audit paras in the Rs2 billion\
  \ NLC scam, lease of railways land to a social club in Lahore and summoning the\
  \ Supreme Court registrar before the committee for scrutiny of SC expenditure.When\
  \ the previous PAC took up the NLC case and held three retired generals responsible\
  \ for losses in the cell, former army chief General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani announced\
  \ that the GHQ would investigate the case. The investigation report is still awaited.Since\
  \ the audit para is still pending before the committee, it would surely be taken\
  \ up by its new members.The lease of railways land to Royal Palm Golf and Country\
  \ Club in Lahore remained under discussion in the previous PAC. Federal auditors\
  \ claimed that the lease of 141 acres of land resulted in over Rs10 billion loss\
  \ to the national exchequer. Although the case is pending before the court, its\
  \ audit para had to be settled by the PAC.The previous PAC had repeatedly asked\
  \ the SC registrar to appear before it for mandatory presentation of accounts, but\
  \ a full court sitting stopped the registrar from doing so.When asked if he will\
  \ summon the SC registrar, Mr Shah said the PAC would follow the constitutional\
  \ provision that a government organisation that received funds from the national\
  \ kitty had to appear before the committee.Audit reports from 2008 to 2011, when\
  \ the PPP was in power, are ready to be taken up by the new PAC. Mr Shah said the\
  \ PAC would work above party lines and that\u2019s how it could carry out across-the-board\
  \ accountability.The PAC chairman said he would not meet principal accounting officers\
  \ of government organisations to ensure transparency in the working of the committee.\
  \ Instead, the additional secretary of the committee will hold meetings.Asked if\
  \ he would use suo motu powers, Mr Shah replied in the negative.Meanwhile, the government\

text: '  MINNEAPOLIS: Two people were killed and nine injured on Wednesday after a
  gas explosion ripped through a Christian private school in Minneapolis, US starting
  a fire and causing a building to collapse, authorities said. The body of a school
  employee was recovered at 8 pm CDT from the rubble at the Minnehaha Academy, about
  10 hours after the explosion, Minneapolis Fire Chief John Fruetel told a news conference.
  Fruetel declined to identify either victim pending notification of next of kin.
  The Minneapolis Star-Tribune reported that the remains removed earlier in the day
  were those of Ruth Berg, a 47-year-old receptionist at the school who was engaged
  to be married. Family members earlier told local news channel KARE that John Carlson,
  an 81-year-old custodian, was missing and that no one had been able to reach him.
  The nine people who were injured were taken to local hospitals, and one was in critical
  condition, Fruetel said. The school was not in session due to summer break, Fruetel
  said.  It would have been dramatically worse   we were pretty lucky in that sense,  he
  said. Authorities said there were early indications that a ruptured gas line may
  have led to the explosion and that it was caused by contractors working at the school.
  The academy confirmed on Facebook that there had been a gas leak and explosion at
  its Upper School.  This is a day of extraordinary heartbreak in Minneapolis,  Mayor
  Betsy Hodges told the news conference. The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms
  and Explosives said on Twitter its agents, fire investigators and trained canines
  were at the site of the explosion. Phillip Day, 41, said he, his wife and their
  17-year-old daughter, Chimali, had been meeting a counsellor at the school to discuss
  college options when the explosion occurred. Day said that, as they left a conference
  room, his daughter was blown back through the door by the force of the blast and
  his wife was scraped. Tramon Van Leer, 33, was in the gym at the Minnehaha Academy
  playing basketball with his stepdaughter and four other girls when they heard the
  blast. After they ran outside to safety, Van Leer said he looked back and said:  Wow,
  the whole section of the school is gone.  According to its website, Minnehaha Academy
  was founded in 1913 and teaches more than 800 students from pre-kindergarten through
  12th grade on two campuses.   Related '

  for the hajj, authorities said Thursday, with the annual pilgrimage marked by the
  return of Iranians after Tehran s boycott last year. More than two million people
  are expected to participate in this year s hajj, a pillar of Islam that capable
  Muslims must perform at least once in their lives, which starts next week.  So far
  1,313,946 pilgrims have arrived by air, 79,501 by land, and 12,477 by sea   an increase
  of 33 percent compared with the same period last year,  the state-run Saudi Press
  Agency said, citing passport officials. That includes more than 400 Qatari pilgrims,
  local media reported, despite an intensifying row between Doha and Riyadh over arrangements
  for the religious event. All Qatari pilgrims arrived through the Salwa border crossing
  with Qatar. The hajj has been clouded by the worst political crisis in the Gulf
  in decades, with Saudi Arabia leading a four-state bloc that suspended all ties
  with Doha on June 5 over accusations the emirate backed Islamist extremists. Qatar
  has denied the charge and said this week it was worried pilgrims from the emirate
  would be treated badly. But the Saudi media has repeatedly broadcast images showing
  officials courteously assisting Qatari pilgrims. The hajj ministry has said the
  kingdom, home to Islam s holiest sites, welcomes all pilgrims from different nationalities.
  The ministry added it was equipped to handle the additional crowds after the completion
  of expansion works at the Grand Mosque in Mecca, the most revered site in Islam.
  More than 1.8 million faithful took part in last year s hajj. But Iran s 64,000
  pilgrims stayed away for the first time in three decades after tensions between
  Riyadh and Tehran boiled over following a deadly stampede during the 2015 pilgrimage.
  An agreement was reached earlier this year to allow Iranians to take part in the
  hajj. Iran and Saudi Arabia will soon exchange diplomatic visits, Tehran said this
  week, in a possible sign of tensions easing after the archrivals cut ties last year.

  the country, but one thing transcends region, religion, ethnicity, age and political
  affiliation. That thing is cricket. It s the most popular sport in the country,
  with heroes from the game independently going on to inspire generations. It unites
  the whole nation, and makes you forget about any political differences. That s the
  value of cricket to Pakistan. It s an Eid of cricket in Karachi, a city of over
  20 million cricket-mad people that hasn t played host to a game of this magnitude
  for over nine years. Peshawar Zalmi are set to take on Islamabad United in a high-voltage
  PSL final at National Stadium Karachi   a venue set to host its first high-profile
  game since the Pakistan-Sri Lanka Test in February 2009. The game is billed as a
  homecoming, what with Pakistan s biggest city having been deprived of major cricket
  for almost a decade. The focus of the event has been the extraordinary security
  in the city, but there s plenty to focus on as far as the cricket is concerned,
  too. Both teams have one PSL title to their name, with Peshawar being defending
  champions, while Islamabad won the inaugural edition in 2016. Both are presently
  at the top of their game and made their way to the final with some brutal displays
  with the bat. There seems to be no real weak link in either team, as both are laden
  with experienced batsmen from top to middle, and boast powerful bowling attacks.
  The stadium has, over the years, largely been isolated, only hosting domestic cricket,
  but the infrastructure was put back together a few months before the game. The stadium
  is still under renovation, but the facility was prepared enough to make sure it
  was able to get going for the important game. The final is anticipated for its own
  merits as a contest, of course, but an absorbing mini-contest revolves around the
  dazzling form of each side s wicketkeeper-batsman. Kamran Akmal and Luke Ronchi
  are both 36, have both been opening the batting, and presently sit at No. 1 and
  No. 3 on the PSL run charts with 424 and 383 runs respectively. Both are major reasons
  for their respective teams making the final this season. Both have exhibited extraordinary
  skill in power-hitting, and are brimming with the confidence, and will be at the
  forefront of their respective opposition bowling attacks leading into the game.
  Despite safety concerns among foreign players overshadowing the games themselves,
  both teams have managed to retain the services of most of their best overseas players
  for the marquee game. This was in stark contrast to last year, when all of Quetta
  Gladiators  foreign players pulled out while Peshawar Zalmi fielded a full-strength
  side. Misbah ul Haq missed the Qualifier with a hairline fracture in his wrist.
  The 43-year-old has been struggling for fitness, and will miss the final. Islamabad
  are likely to stick to their combination from the Dubai game where they beat Karachi
  Kings by eight wickets with 45 balls to spare. One enforced change will be the absence
  of Alex Hales, who pulled out due to security concerns. Islamabad United (likely):
  1 Luke Ronchi (wk), 2 Sahibzada Farhan, 3 JP Duminy (capt), 4 Hussain Talat, 5 Samit
  Patel, 6 Asif Ali, 7 Chadwick Walton/Samuel Badree, 8 Shadab Khan, 9 Faheem Ashraf,
  10 Mohammad Sami, 11 Amad Butt Kamran Akmal has been playing despite a stiff neck
  and a hamstring niggle but with three days of rest before the game should have had
  enough time to regain his fitness. Peshawar are likely to retain their winning combination.
  Peshawar Zalmi (likely): 1 Kamran Akmal (wk), 2 Andre Fletcher, 3 Mohammad Hafeez,
  4 Saad Nasim, 5 Liam Dawson, 6 Darren Sammy (capt), 7 Chris Jordan, 8 Hasan Ali,
  9 Wahab Riaz, 10 Umaid Asif, 11 Sameen Gul. Related '

  to the Independent Election Commission (IEC) information, the voter registration
  drive would be completed in two phases   first in cities and the second phase in
  districts centers and villages. However, the IEC extended the voter registration
  deadline for another month both in districts and provinces. A IEC list, available
  with Pajhwok Afghan News, shows that till yesterday s afternoon more than two million
  and 300,000 people have registered their names at voter registration centers nationwide.
  Based on the commission s information during the past 36 days, 23,18,040 individuals
  including 1597909 men and 668200 women were enrolled at voter registration centers.
  According to the established list, 51,494 Kuchis and 437 Hindus are among those
  registered so far. As fears were raised about stickers on ID cards, the Presidential
  Palace said those having problem with the sticker can put the sticker on the ID
  card copy, a decision to which the IEC finally agreed.     Related '

text: '  Monitoring Desk KABUL: An estimated 160,000 to 200,000 children under one
  year of age in Afghanistan   one in three   received zero vaccinations last year,
  the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) said in a statement on Wednesday. These gaps
  in routine immunization coverage not only put the lives of under-vaccinated children
  at risk but also everyone around them. Insecurity in parts of the country reduces
  access for health workers to reach children and for families to get to health clinics,
  while displaced populations and those living in remote areas are also more likely
  to miss out on vaccines.  Immunization is the right of every child, we must accelerate
  our efforts to ensure all children in the country are vaccinated and protected from
  preventable diseases,  said H.E. Minister for Public Health, Dr Ferozuddin Feroz.  Through
  immunization we can protect children from diseases, such as measles, polio and pneumonia   a
  major killer of children under 5 years of age,  Dr, Feroz added. The remarks come
  as Afghanistan marks,  World Immunization Week , which is celebrated annually, 24-30
  April, to raise awareness about the importance of vaccination and ensure that people
  take action to receive all required life-saving vaccines. The theme for 2018 is:  Protected
  Together, #VaccinesWork . Efforts to eradicate polio also continue in Afghanistan
  and most of the country remains polio-free. In 2018, there have been 7 polio cases,
  mostly restricted to high-risk areas in the southern and eastern regions.  We are
  seeing improvements in routine immunization coverage and new vaccines have been
  introduced,  said Dr Richard Peeperkorn, WHO representative in Afghanistan.  But
  the country is still behind schedule on the targets for disease eradication and
  elimination, including polio, measles, rubella, and maternal and neonatal tetanus.
  We must make more concerted efforts to reach all Global Vaccine Action Plan goals
  by 2020,  Dr. Peeperkorn added. The Global Vaccine Action Plan was endorsed by the
  World Health Assembly in 2012 and is a commitment to ensure that no one misses out
  on vital immunization by 2020.  We must all commit to providing every child with
  the lifesaving vaccines they need,  said Stefano Savi, UNICEF s deputy representative
  in Afghanistan.  This includes reaching the most vulnerable children, who are often
  affected by conflict or living in the most remote areas of the country. Children
  in Afghanistan have the right to get the best start in life, to develop and progress
  like any child,  Savi added. Immunization saves millions of lives globally each
  year and is widely recognized as one of the world s most successful and cost-effective
  health interventions. Key facts and progress: The number of health centres providing
  immunization services increased by 12 per cent to 1,767 facilities around the country.
  In 2017, some 1,250,000 children, under one year old, were vaccinated in against
  measles, polio, whooping cough, tetanus, diphtheria, pneumonia, meningitis and tuberculosis.
  In 2017, 900,000 pregnant women and children younger than 5 were provided with medicines
  for antenatal care, newborn care, pneumonia, diarrhoea and meningitis. 10 antigens
  are currently included in Afghanistan s routine immunization programme, available
  free of charge. In recent years, Afghanistan has introduced new vaccines, including
  the Pentavalent vaccine protecting people from five deadly diseases and the Pneumococcal
  vaccine to fight pneumonia. This year, the Ministry of Public Health introduced
  the Rota vaccine, it s hoped that this will significantly reduce mortality due to
  diarrhea in the country, From July to September 2018, a nationwide measles immunization
  campaign will target 14 million children, aged 10 months to five years.     Related '

  \ a safe haven for Pakistani bowlers.Had he not been replaced, just imagine the\
  \ mess Akmal would have made off Hashim Amla\u2019s nudge.Like countless sad stories\
  \ of dumping and nepotism in Pakistan Cricket, Sarfaraz is no stranger to hardships\
  \ and baseless criticism. Often sidelined for unexplained reasons, the street fighter\
  \ has the habit of crawling his way back through some stellar performances.Some\
  \ circles scared of his skills and leadership qualities have discouraged and deliberately\
  \ tried to keep him out of the team. During a recent tour, his visa was purposely\
  \ delayed and a fellow keeper kept on telling him that he will be replacing Sarfaraz\
  \ on the tour. Sarfaraz eventually went on the tour, though he was dropped soon\
  \ afterwards without given right opportunities.Right after the 2012 Asia Cup, he\
  \ was dubbed as \u201CNot a good enough batsman\u201D and was dropped from the next\
  \ outing.A further shock came with him not being awarded the Central Contract.Expecting\

text: 'KARACHI: The Federal Government and provinces are neither serious about nor
  taking an interest in holding population and housing census in the country. It s
  a legal obligation imposed on the Federal Government in the Federal Legislative
  list of fourth schedule to the Constitution; nevertheless, hurdles are being created
  to delay or stop the sixth census in Pakistan, as mentioned in Aam log Ittehad Petition
  filed in the Supreme Court of Pakistan. According to Petitioner Justice (retd) Wajihuddin
  Ahmed, Acting Chairman Aam Loeg Ittehad:  While the first four censuses were more
  or less regularly and duly held in the years 1951, 1961, 1972 and 1981, the fifth
  census was undertaken in 1998 after 17 years, an inordinate delay of 7 years which
  was certainly avoidable. That is not to say that the pervious censuses were problem
  free.  However, we are now in the 21st century and living in the Information Age,
  with little or no scope for such aberrations.  Justice Wajihuddin Ahmed said in
  a separate statement:  None of the governments are serious in the matter, though
  for different reasons. The Federal Government is engaged in a mechanical exercise,
  solely because it has to honor its undertaking before the apex court. The sardars
  and Khans of Balochistan and KP feel threatened that once their impecunious and
  burgeoning populations are quantified, their own lavish and luxurious lifestyles
  would come under scrutiny. The Sindh government, which exclusively represents rural
  Sindh, is determined to inflate the numbers in rural areas and decimate those in
  urban Sindh.  Justice Wajih further said that the census is an activity necessary
  to assess the needs on the basis of population, and this act will be beneficial
  for human rights. The petition points out that the leadership of Punjab is no wiser.
  It is fully aware that the proportion of their population is slowly declining and
  if census is held it would no longer be officially reflected as being 55.63% of
  the population of Pakistan. The estimated Punjab population, as per the 2011 Housing
  Census, is 47.69%. In the previous census of 1998, while a slower per annum growth
  rate of 2.64% in Punjab was recorded, Sindh registered a growth rate of 2.80% per
  annum. The petition further states that if this trend continues, it is bound to
  have a negative impact on the 148 National Assembly seats allocated to the province
  of Punjab under the Constitution. In order to maintain and ensure the numerical
  majority of the province of Punjab in the population census of Pakistan, some functionaries
  of the Punjab government are keen to have the exercise of the forthcoming census
  abandoned. The notables of Punjab need to realise that if the present population
  ratio of their province is unrealistically maintained and reflected to be higher
  than it actually is, history may repeat itself. In similar circumstances, the former
  province of East Pakistan, having a 54% share of the total population, seceded,
  not the least for the reason that the former province of West Pakistan was not in
  favour of the idea of remaining a permanent minority province, says the petition.
  The petition notes that the situation is particularly sensitive in Sindh because
  at this eleventh hour the government is proactively pursuing the issuance of CNICs
  in rural areas. It is no secret that the government of Sindh only and exclusively
  represents rural Sindh, with a predictable tilt in that direction. Its unchecked
  participation in the census exercise, which, as stated in the preceding paragraph,
  is a Federal subject/entry, occurring in Part II of the Federal Legislative List,
  controlled by Articles 153(4) and 154 (1) (6) ), is likely to produce unacceptable
  results. Aam Loeg Ittehad petition states that there is hue and cry in Balochistan
  that if the current census, in the present situation, is carried out the Baloch
  people shall be relegated to being a minority in their own province. Nothing can
  be farther from the truth. The Baloch people, who are purported to have moved to
  Sindh and Punjab, can easily be counted at their present places of residence.  And
  if some Afghan refugees, in Balochistan, now possess Pakistan CNICs, they can always
  be carefully screened and excluded from the head count of the forthcoming population
  census. Thereafter, their illegal Pakistan CNICs can be replaced by other distinctive
  cards of identification. Much the same is the position in KP, where provincial leaders
  have shown apprehension that if some migrants from Afghanistan, who are unlawfully
  holding Pakistan CNICs, are counted, as part of the population, the Pashtuns would
  be converted into a minority. That also is as illogical a position as taken by the
  Baloch sardars. For one thing, an inflated KP population would bring similar benefits,
  as in the case of Balochistan and in any case the electoral process would remain
  unaffected, as in the case of Balochistan, states the petition. It has been requested
  of the Honorable Court to direct the Federal Government to assume full jurisdiction
  in the matter of the forthcoming census and provide directions and guidance to the
  Council of Common Interests, as and when necessary. The Court has also been appealed
  to direct the Federal and Provincial Governments of Pakistan to ensure full, complete
  and absolute compliance of law and the Constitution in the matter of the forthcoming
  census. Census is not just for the head-count of Pakistani citizens (CNIC holders)
  but of all persons in Pakistan who must be counted on the basis of due and verifiable
  particulars and only after securing due clarification of valid CNIC holders. The
  petition has further requested the Court to issue directions to NADRA, through the
  Chair NADRA to cancel all illegal CNICs and, where needed, to issue other cards/insignias
  for identification of persons holding illegal CNICs. And also to prohibit NADRA
  from issuing new CNICs at least one month prior to the start of the first phase
  of the census. It has also been requested that the Court prohibit all Provincial
  Governments from any and all direct or indirect interaction with the census functionaries,
  and to ensure that no census result is announced until the Armed Forces  component
  of the census personnel expressly approves it. '

text: 'More than 1,200 people have been killed across South Asia in monsoon storms
  so far this year, according to figures collected by AFP as India counts the rising
  toll from floods that have devastated southern Kerala state.  The monsoon, which
  lasts from June to September, causes widespread death and destruction across South
  Asia each year, with the tourist hotspot of Kerala suffering its worst floods in
  nearly 100 years. Kerala has reported 445 deaths with more bodies discovered each
  day as a massive cleanup gets underway. The floods forced more than a million people
  to seek shelter in temporary relief camps and 15 others were reported missing up
  to Monday.  Kerala accounted for nearly half of the more than 1,000 deaths reported
  across India, with over 160 killed in neighbouring Karnataka state, more than 200
  fatalities in Uttar Pradesh state, and 195 in West Bengal, according to official
  figures. The monsoon also battered Nepal, with 87 people killed since June, according
  to the home ministry, including a woman and eight children swept away by a landslide
  in a remote village. But in Sri Lanka, where authorities organised the early evacuation
  of 750,000 people in threatened areas this year, the death toll from monsoon floods
  fell to 24 from 224 killed in May and June last year, official figures showed. In
  Bangladesh, floods and landslides killed at least 29 people, according to official
  figures. In the deadliest monsoon-induced disaster in recent years in South Asia,
  flooding and landslides killed around 5,800 people in India s northern Uttarakhand
  state in June 2013. '

text: 'Many European Union member states have failed the migrant victims of torture
  and trauma by not having systems in place to recognise the ordeals they have suffered,
  and support them on arrival. Such trauma if left untreated can scar them and their
  families for life, and may lead to suicide. These are some of the findings from
  the latest summary report of the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) on migration-related
  fundamental rights concerns in select EU member states. It examines how victims
  are being handled by national authorities to highlight how to best offer them the
  protection they are entitled to. Many migrants and asylum seekers have fled or experienced
  extreme suffering in their home countries or en route to Europe. This includes physical
  and psychological violence, torture, inhuman or degrading treatment. Lengthy bureaucracy,
  uncertainty about the outcome of asylum proceedings and poor reception conditions
  can compound their suffering. In Denmark alone, there were 120 suicide attempts
  and incidents of suicidal behaviour among asylum seekers in 2016, of which 29 were
  by children. Despite international and EU laws guarding against such treatment offering
  support to victims, many member states are falling short of their duties, the report
  shows. Some of the report s main findings include:  1. The true extent of suffering
  is hard to gauge as only limited data on the victims of torture and trauma and on
  suicide attempts is collected in the 13 member states studied. Only Greece regularly
  collects information on torture victims.  2.  Recurrent violence or the excessive
  use of force by state officials or those working on their behalf was not found although
  there were cases of individual and localised incidents. However, serious incidents
  are more frequent along EU external border zones.  3.  Identifying victims is problematic
  given the lack of formal screening procedures. Instead countries heavily rely on
  the expertise and knowledge of individual staff, although tools are increasingly
  being developed to facilitate identification by non-experts.   4.  Access to support
  is limited by the number of specialised medical staff who can provide psychological
  or psychiatric help. The lack of staff often leads to long waiting periods; for
  example, in Germany around 5,600 asylum seekers waited over a year to receive treatment.
  It is also a challenge starting therapy when asylum applicants are homeless or live
  in reception facilities that are not adequate to sustain the therapy.   5.  Despite
  training, monitoring bodies and complaints mechanisms in all member states, their
  effectiveness in preventing ill-treatment varies from country to country. Despite
  the lack of attention to torture and trauma victims, the report also identifies
  promising practices that other member states could adopt to identify and support
  victims. The European Commission asked the Agency for Fundamental Rights to collect
  data about the fundamental rights situation of people arriving in member states,
  particularly affected by large migration movements. The reports cover 14 member
  states: Austria, Bulgaria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy,
  the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, Spain and Sweden. '
